<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume is a sequel to <i>The Unity of Western
Civilization</i> published last year and arose in the
same way, from a course of lectures given at the
Woodbrooke Settlement, Birmingham.</p>

<p>The former book attempted to describe some of
the permanent unifying factors which hold our
Western civilization together in spite of such
catastrophic divisions as the present war. This
book attempts to show these forces in growth. The
former aimed rather at a statical, the present at
a dynamical view of the same problem. Both are
historical in spirit.</p>

<p>It is hoped that these courses may serve as an
introduction to a series of cognate studies, of
which clearly both the supply and the scope
are infinite, for under the general conception of
'Progress in Unity' all great human topics
might be embraced. One subject has been
suggested for early treatment which would have
especial interest at the present time, viz. 'Recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Progress in European Thought'. We are by the
war brought more closely than before into contact
with other nations of Europe who are pursuing
with inevitable differences the same main lines
of evolution. To indicate these in general, with
stress on the factor of betterment, is the aim of
the present volume.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h2>THE IDEA OF PROGRESS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">F. S. Marvin</span></h3>


<p>The editor of these essays was busy in the autumn of
last year collating the opinions attached by different
people to the word 'progress'. One Sunday afternoon
he happened to be walking with two friends in Oxford,
one a professor of philosophy, the other a lady. The
professor of philosophy declared that to him human
progress must always mean primarily the increase of
knowledge; the editor urged the increase of power as its
most characteristic feature, but the lady added at once
that to her progress had always meant, and could only
mean, increase in our appreciation of the humanity of
others.</p>

<p>The first two thoughts, harmonized and directed by the
third, may be taken to cover the whole field, and this
volume to be merely a commentary upon them. What
we have to consider is, when and how this idea of progress,
as a general thing affecting mankind as a whole, first
appeared in the world, how far it has been realized in
history, and how far it gives us any guidance and hope
for the future. In the midst of a catastrophe which
appears at first sight to be a deadly blow to the ideal,
such an inquiry has a special interest and may have some
permanent value.</p>

<p>Words are the thought of ages crystallized, or rather
embodied with a constantly growing soul. The word
'Progress', like the word 'Humanity', is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
most significant. It is a Latin word, not used in its
current abstract sense until after the Roman incorporation
of the Mediterranean world. It contains Greek
thought summed up and applied by Roman minds. Many
of the earlier Greek thinkers, Xenophanes and Empedocles
as well as Plato and Aristotle, had thought and
spoken of a steady process in things, including man
himself, from lower to higher forms; but the first writer
who expounds the notion with sufficient breadth of view
and sufficiently accurate and concrete observation to
provide a preliminary sketch, was the great Roman poet
who attributed all the best that was in him to the Greeks
and yet has given us a highly original picture of the
upward tendency of the world and of human society
upon it. He, too, so far as one can discover, was the first
to use the word 'progress' in the sense of our inquiry.
The passage in Lucretius at the end of his fifth book on the
Nature of Things is so true and brilliant and anticipates
so many points in later thought that it is worth quoting
at some length, and the poet's close relation with Cicero,
the typical Greco-Roman thinker, gives his ideas the more
weight as an historical document.</p>

<p>He begins by describing a struggle for existence in
which the less well-adapted creatures died off, those who
wanted either the power to protect themselves or the
means of adapting themselves to the purposes of man.
In this stage, however, man was a hardier creature than he
afterwards became. He lived like the beasts of the field
and was ignorant of tillage or fire or clothes or houses.
He had no laws or government or marriage, and though he
did not fear the dark, he feared the real danger of fiercer
beasts. Men often died a miserable death, but not in
multitudes on a single day as they do now by battle or
shipwreck.</p>

<p>The next stage sees huts and skins and fire which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
softened their bodies, and marriage and the ties of family
which softened their tempers. And tribes began to make
treaties of alliance with other tribes.</p>

<p>Speech arose from the need which all creatures feel to
exercise their natural powers, just as the calf will butt
before his horns protrude. Men began to apply different
sounds to denote different things, just as brute beasts will
do to express different passions, as any one must have
noticed in the cases of dogs and horses and birds. No
one man set out to invent speech.</p>

<p>Fire was first learnt from lightning and the friction
of trees, and cooking from the softening and ripening of
things by the sun.</p>

<p>Then men of genius invented improved methods of life,
the building of cities and private property in lands and
cattle. But gold gave power to the wealthy and destroyed
the sense of contentment in simple happiness. It must
always be so whenever men allow themselves to become
the slaves of things which should be their dependants
and instruments.</p>

<p>They began to believe in and worship gods, because
they saw in dreams shapes of preterhuman strength and
beauty and deemed them immortal; and as they noted
the changes of the seasons and all the wonders of the
heavens, they placed their gods there and feared them
when they spoke in the thunder.</p>

<p>Metals were discovered through the burning of the
woods, which caused the ores to run. Copper and brass
came first and were rated above gold and silver. And
then the metals took the place of hands, nails, teeth, and
clubs, which had been men's earliest arms and tools.
Weaving followed the discovery of the use of iron.</p>

<p>Sowing, planting, and grafting were learnt from nature
herself, and gradually the cultivation of the soil was
carried farther and farther up the hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Men learnt to sing from the birds, and to blow on pipes
from the whistling of the zephyr through the reeds: and
those simple tunes gave as much rustic jollity as our more
elaborate tunes do now.</p>

<p>Then, in a summary passage at the end, Lucretius
enumerates all the chief discoveries which men have made
in the age-long process&mdash;ships, agriculture, walled cities,
laws, roads, clothes, songs, pictures, statues, and all the
pleasures of life&mdash;and adds, 'these things practice and
the experience of the unresting mind have taught mankind
gradually as they have progressed from point to
point'.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is the first definition and use of the word in literature.
If we accept it as a typical presentation of the Greco-Roman
view, seen by a man of exceptional genius and
insight at the climax of the period, there are two or three
points which must arrest our attention. Lucretius is
thinking mainly of progress in the arts, and especially
of the arts as they affect man's happiness. There is no
mention of increase in knowledge or in love. As in the
famous parallel passage in Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i>, it is man's
strength and skill which most impressed the poet, and his
skill especially as exhibited in the arts. Compared with
what we shall see as typical utterances of later times, it
is an external view of the subject. The absence of love
as an element of progress carries with it the absence of
the idea of humanity. There is no conception here, nor
anywhere in classical thought before the Stoics, of a world-wide
Being which has contributed to the advance and
should share fully in its fruits. Still less do we find any
hint of the possibilities of an infinite progress. The moral,
on the contrary, is that we should limit our desires, banish
disturbing thoughts, and settle down to a quiet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sensible enjoyment of the good things that advancing
skill has provided for us. It is, of course, true that thoughts
can be found in individual writers, especially in Plato and
Aristotle, which would largely modify this view. Yet it
can hardly be questioned that Lucretius here represents
the prevalent tone of thoughtful men of his day. They
had begun to realize the fact of human progress, but
envisaged it, as was natural in a first view, mainly on
the external side, and, above all, had no conception of
its infinite possibilities.</p>

<p>When we turn to typical utterances of the next great
age in history the contrast is striking. Catholic doctrine
had absorbed much that was congenial to it from the
Stoics, from Plato and Aristotle, but it added a thing that
was new in the world, a passionate love and an overpowering
desire for personal moral improvement. This
is so clear in the greatest figures of the Middle Ages, men
such as St. Bernard and St. Francis, and it is so unlike
anything that we know in the world before, that we are
justified in treating it as characteristic of the age. To
some of us, indeed, it will appear as the most important
element in the general notion of progress which we are
tracing. It so appeared to Comte.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of numberless
passages that might be quoted from fathers and doctors
of the Church, a few words from Nicholas of Cusa must
suffice. He was a divine of the early fifteenth century,
true to the faith, but anxious to improve the discipline
of the Church. To him progress took an entirely spiritual
form. 'To be able to understand more and more without
end is the type of eternal wisdom.... Let a man desire
to understand better what he does understand and to
love more what he does love and the whole world will
not satisfy him.'</p>

<p>Here is a point of view so different from the last that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
we find some difficulty in fitting it into the same scheme
of things. Yet both are essential elements in Western
civilization; both have been developed by the operations
of similar forces in the world civilized and incorporated
by Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>The Catholic divine looks entirely inward for his idea of
progress, and his conception contains elements of real and
permanent validity, of which our present notions are full.
His eyes are turned towards the future and there is no
limit to his vision. And though the progress contemplated
is within the soul of the individual believer, it
rests on the two fundamental principles of knowledge
and love which are both essentially social. The believer
may isolate himself from the world to develop his higher
nature, but the knowledge and the love which he carries
with him into his solitude are themselves fruits of that
intercourse with his fellows from which an exclusive
religious ideal temporarily cuts him off.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that Catholic doctrine and discipline,
though aiming at this perfection of the individual rather
than of the race, was embodied in an organization which
carried farther than the Roman Empire the idea of a
united civilization and furnished to many thinkers,
Bossuet as well as Dante, a first sketch of the progress of
mankind.</p>

<p>But it is clear that this construction was provisional
only, either on the side of personal belief and practice,
or of ecclesiastical organization; provisional, that is, if
we are looking for real unity in the mind of mankind.
For we need a doctrine, a scheme of knowledge, into
which all that we discover about the world and our own
nature may find its place; we need principles of action
which will guide us in attaining a state of society more
congruent with our knowledge of the possibilities of the
world and human nature, more thoroughly inspired by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
human love, love of man for man as a being living his
span of life here and now, under conditions which call for
a concentration of skill and effort to realize the best.
The breaking of the old Catholic synthesis, narrow but
admirable within its limits, took place at what we call the
Renascence and Reformation; the linking up of a new one
is the task of our own and many later generations. Let it
not be thought that such a change involves the destruction
of any vital element in the idea of progress already
achieved; if true and vital, every element must survive.
But it does involve an acceptance of the fact that progress,
or humanity, or the evolution of the divine within
us&mdash;however we prefer to phrase it&mdash;is a larger thing
than any one organization or any one set of carefully
harmonized doctrines. The truth, and the organ in
which we enshrine it, must grow with the human minds
who are collectively producing it. The new unity is
itself progress.</p>

<p>It must give us confidence in facing such a prospect to
observe that at each remove from the first appearance
of the idea of progress in the world man's use of the word
has carried more meaning and, though sometimes quieter
in tone, as in recent times, is better grounded in the
facts of life and history. Such an advance in our conceptions
took place after the Renascence. At the beginning
of the seventeenth century, when the art and science
of the ancient world had been recovered, the word and
the idea of progress started on a fresh course of unexampled
vigour. The lines were closer to those of the pre-Christian
than of the Catholic world, but it would be by no means
true to call them pagan. When Bacon and Descartes begin
to sound the modern note of progress, they think primarily
of an advance in the arts and sciences, but there is a
spiritual and human side to their ideal which could not
be really paralleled in classical thought. The Spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Man is now invoked, and this, not in the sense of an &eacute;lite,
the builders of the Greek State or the rulers of the Roman
Empire, but of mankind as a whole. This is Christian, or
perhaps we should say, Stoical-Christian. Thus Descartes
tells us that he looks to science to furnish us ultimately
with an art which will make us 'masters and possessors of
nature ... and this not solely for the pleasure of enjoying
with ease the good things of the world, but principally
for the preservation and improvement of human health
which is both the foundation of all other goods and the
means of strengthening the spirit itself' ('Discours de la
M&eacute;thode'). It is significant that the two words Progress
and Humanity come into use in their modern sense side by
side. The latter is the basis and the ideal of the former.</p>

<p>But the new thing which had come into the world at
this point, and gives a fresh impulse and content to the
idea of progress, is the development of science. The
Greeks had founded it and, as we shall see in a later
chapter, it was the recovery of the Greek thread which
gave the moderns their clue. But no one before the
sixteenth century, before the marvels revealed by Galileo's
telescope and knit up by Newton's synthetic genius,
could have conceived the visions of human regeneration
by science which light up the pioneers of the seventeenth
century and are the gospel of the eighteenth.</p>

<p>We turn to the eighteenth century, and primarily to
the school of thinkers called 'philosophes' in France, for
the fullest and most enthusiastic statement of progress
as a gospel. It is, of course, European, as all the greatest
advances of thought have been; and German thinkers, as
well as English, stand with the French in the vanguard.
Kant and Herder, from different points of view, thought it
out perhaps more thoroughly than any one else at that time;
but the French believed in it as a nation and were willing
to stake their lives and souls on the belief. Thus Turgot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
before the Revolution, declared that 'the total mass of
the human race marches continually though sometimes
slowly towards an ever-increasing perfection'. And
Condorcet, in the midst of the Revolution, while himself
under its ban, painted a picture 'of the human race,
freed from its chains, and marching with a firm tread
on the road of truth and virtue and happiness'.</p>

<p>Here is the gospel in its purest and simplest form, and
when we are inclined to think that the crimes and the
partial failure of the Revolution discredit its principles,
it is well to remember that the man who believed in them
most systematically, expounded his belief with perfect
calmness and confidence as he lay under sentence of death
from a revolutionary tribunal.</p>

<p>If this enthusiasm is madness, we might all well wish to
be possessed. The true line of criticism is different. At
the Revolution, as before at the Renascence, the leaders
of the new movement could not see all their debt to the
past. Like the Renascence, they idealized certain features
in classical antiquity, but they had not yet gained the
notion of historical continuity; above all, they did not
realize the value of the religious development of the
Middle Ages. It was left for the nineteenth century and
for us, its successors, to attempt the supreme task of
seeing things steadily and seeing them whole.</p>

<p>For in spite of the capital contributions of the Renascence
to progress and the idea of progress, especially by
its scientific constructions, it is undeniable that a bias
was then given to the course of Western civilization from
which it has suffered ever since, and which it is now our
urgent duty to correct. Two aspects of this may be
specified. The old international unity which Rome had
achieved, at least superficially, in the Mediterranean
world, and which the Catholic Church had extended and
deepened, was broken up in favour of a system of sovereign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and independent states controlling religion and influencing
education on lines calculated to strengthen the national
forces and the national forces alone. They even believed
that, at any rate in trade and commerce, the interests of
these independent states were rather rival than co-operative.
The Revolution struck the note of human
association clearly enough, but we have not yet learnt to
set all our other tunes in accord with it. Another, and
perhaps even more fundamental, weakness of the Renascence
tradition was the stress it laid on the material,
mechanical, external side of progress. On the one hand,
the spiritual side of life tended to be identified with that
system of thought and discipline which had been so
rudely disrupted. On the other hand, the new advance
in science brought quickly after it a corresponding growth
of wealth and mechanical inventions and material comforts.
The spirit of man was for the time impeded and
half suffocated by its own productions.</p>

<p>The present war seems to many of us the supreme
struggle of our better nature to gain the mastery over
these obstructions, and freedom for its proper growth.</p>

<p>Now if this analysis be anywhere near the truth, it is
clear that our task for the future is one of synthesis on the
lines of social progress. Knowledge, power, wealth,
increase of skill, increase of health, we have them all in
growing measure, and Mr. Clutton Brock will tell us in
his chapter in this volume that we may be able by an
exercise of will to achieve even a new renascence in art.
But we certainly do not yet possess these things fairly
distributed or in harmony of mind.</p>

<p>The connexion therefore between progress as we now
envisage it, and unity, both in ourselves and in society
at large, becomes apparent. At each of the previous
great moments in the history of the West development
has been secured by emphasis on one side of our nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
at the expense of the rest. Visions of mankind in common
progress have flashed on individual thinkers, a Roman
Emperor, a Catholic Schoolman, a Revolutionary prophet.
But the thing achieved has been one-sided, and the needed
correction has been given by another movement more
one-sided still. The greatest hope of the present day
lies in the fact that in all branches of life, in government
as well as in philosophy, in science as in social reform, in
religion and in international politics, men are now striving
with determination to bind the threads together.</p>

<p>There is no necessary opposition between the rival
forces which have so often led to conflict. In all our
controversies harmony can be reached and has often been
reached by the application of patience, knowledge, and
goodwill. And goodwill implies here the readiness to
submit the particular issue to the arbitration of the
general good. The international question has been so
fully canvassed in these days that it would be superfluous
to discuss it here. The moral is obvious, and abundant
cases throughout the world illustrate the truth that well-organized
nationalities contain in themselves nothing
contrary to the ideal of international peace.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Nor is the
still more persistent and universal opposition of capital
and labour really less amenable to reconciliation, because
in this case also the two factors in the problem are equally
necessary to social progress, and we shall not enter on the
various practical solutions&mdash;co-operation, co-partnership,
partial state-socialism, &amp;c.&mdash;which have been proposed
for a problem which no one believes to be insoluble. The
conflict in our own souls between the things of matter
and sense and the life of the spirit, is more closely germane
to the present argument, because ultimately this has to
be resolved, if not in every mind yet in the dominant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mind of Europe, before the more practical questions can
be generally settled. Harmony here is at the root of
a sound idea of progress.</p>

<p>When the concluding chapters of this volume are
reached it will be seen how fully the recent developments
both in science and philosophy corroborate the line which
is here suggested for the reconciliation of conflicts and
the establishment of a stronger and more coherent notion
of what we may rightly pursue as progress. For both in
science and still more in philosophy attention is being
more and more closely concentrated on the meaning of
life itself, which science approaches by way of its physical
concomitants, and philosophy from the point of view of
consciousness. And while science has been analysing
the characteristics of a living organism, philosophy finds
in our consciousness just that element of community
with others which an organic conception of progress
demands. The only progress of which we can be certain,
the philosopher tells us, is progress in our own consciousness,
which becomes constantly fuller, more knowing, and
more social, as time unfolds. This, he tells us, must
endure, though the storms of passion and nature may
fall upon us.</p>

<p>On such a firm basis we would all gladly build our
faith. No unity can be perfect except that which we
achieve in our own souls, and no progress can be relied
on except that which we can know within, and can
develop from, our own consciousness and our own
powers. But we cannot rest in this. We are bound to
look outside our own consciousness for some objective
correspondence to that progress which our own nature
craves; and history supplies this evidence. It is from
history that we derive the first idea and the accumulating
proofs of the reality of progress. Lucretius's first
sketch is really his summary of social history up to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
point. The Catholic thinker had a wider scope. He was
able to see that the whole course of Greco-Roman civilization
was, from his point of view, a preparation for the
Church which had the care of the spiritual life of man
while on earth. And in the next stage, that in which we
now live, we see all the interests of life taken back again
into the completeness of human progress, and can trace
that complete being, labouring slowly but unmistakably
to a higher state, outside us in the world, as well as within
our own consciousness, which is ready to expand if we will
give it range.</p>

<p>On such lines we may sketch the historical aspect of
progress on which the personal is based; and it is of the
utmost importance to keep the two aspects before us
concurrently, because reliance on the growing fullness of
the individual life to the neglect of the social evolution
is likely to empty that life itself of its true content, to
leave the self-centred visionary absorbed in the contemplation
of some ideal perfection within himself, while the
world outside him from which he ultimately derives his
notions, is toiling and suffering from the want of those
very elements which he is best able to supply.</p>

<p>The succeeding chapters of this book will, it is hoped,
supply some evidence of the concrete reality of progress,
as well as of the tendency to greater coherence and purity
in the ideal itself. It would have been easy to accumulate
evidence; some sides of life are hardly touched on at all.
The collective and the intellectual sides are fully dealt
with both in this and in the volume on <i>The Unity of
Western Civilization</i>. But if we make our survey over
a sufficient space, coming down especially to our own
days, our conclusion as to the advance made in the
physical and moral well-being of mankind, will be hardly
less emphatic. Our average lives are longer and continue
to lengthen, and they are unquestionably spent with far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
less physical suffering than was generally the case at
any previous period. We are bound to give full weight
to this, however much we rightly deplore the deadening
effect of monotonous and mechanical toil on so large
a part of the population. And even for these the opportunities
for a free and improving life are amazingly
enlarged. We groan and chafe at what remains to be
done because of the unexampled size of the modern
industrial populations with which we have to deal. But
we know in some points very definitely what we want,
and we are now all persuaded with John Stuart Mill
that the remedy is in our own hands, 'that all the great
sources of human suffering are in a great degree, many of
them entirely, conquerable by human care and effort.'
This conviction is perhaps the greatest step of all that we
have gained. In morality some pertinent and necessary
questions are raised in Chap. VI, but the general progress
would be doubted by very few who have had the opportunity
of comparing the evidence as to any previous
state of morals, say in the Middle Ages or in the Elizabethan
age&mdash;the crown of the Renascence in England&mdash;with
that of the present day. The capital advance in
morality, which by itself would be sufficient to justify
our thesis, is the increase in the consciousness and the
obligation of the 'common weal', that conception of
which Government, increasingly better organized, is the
most striking practical realization. It has its drawback
in the spread of what we feel as a debasing 'vulgarity',
but the general balance is overwhelmingly on the side of
good. And in all such discussions we are apt to allow
far too little weight to the change which the New World,
and especially the United States, has brought about.
In matters of personal prosperity and a high general
standard of intellectual and moral competence, what has
been achieved there would outweigh a good deal of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Old World defects when we come to drawing up a world's
balance-sheet.</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that we dismiss altogether any
doctrine of an 'illusion of progress' as a necessary decoy
to progressive action. Progress is a fact as well as an
ideal, and the ideal, though it springs from an objective
reality, will always be in advance of it. So it is with all
man's activities when he comes to man's estate. In
science he has always an ideal of a more perfect knowledge
before him though he becomes scientific by experience.
In art he is always striving to idealize fresh things,
though he first becomes an artist from the pure spontaneous
pleasure of expressing what is in him. The
deliberate projection of the ideal into the future, seeing
how far it will take us and whether we are journeying in
the right direction, is a late stage. As to progress, the
largest general ideal which can affect man's action, it is
only recently that mankind as a whole has been brought
to grips with the conception, also enlarged to the full. He
was standing, somewhat bewildered, somewhat dazzled,
before it, when the war, like an eclipse of the sun, came
suddenly and darkened the view. But an eclipse has been
found an invaluable time for studying some of the
problems of the sun's nature and of light itself.</p>

<p>One of the most acute critics of the mid-Victorian
prophets of progress, Dr. John Grote, did very well in
disentangling the ideal element which is inherent in every
sound doctrine of progress as a guide to conduct. He took
the theory of a continuous inevitable progress in human
affairs, and showed how this by itself might lead to
a weakening of the will, on which alone in his view
progress in the proper sense depends. He took the
mechanical theory of utilitarianism and subjected it
to a similar analysis. We cannot evaluate progress
as an increase in a sum-total of happiness. This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
incapable of calculation, and if we aim directly at it,
we are likely to lose the higher things on which it depends,
and which are capable of being made the objects
of that direct striving which is essential to progress.
Dr. Grote's analysis has long since passed into current
philosophical teaching, but he will always be well worth
reading for his fresh and vigorous reasoning and for
the way in which he builds up his own position without
denying the solid contributions of those whom he criticizes.
Complete truth in the matter seems to us to involve
a larger share for the historical element than Dr. Grote
explicitly allows. We grant fully the paramount necessity
for an ideal of progress and for constantly revising,
purifying, and strengthening it. But in its formation
we should trace more than he does to the collective forces
of mankind as expressed in history. These have given
us the ideal and will carry us on towards it by a force
which is greater than, and in one sense independent of, any
individual will. This is the cardinal truth of sociology,
and is obvious if we consider how in matters of everyday
experience we are all compelled by some social force not
ourselves, as for instance in actions tending to maintain
the family or in a national crisis such, as the war. This
general will is not, of course, independent of all the wills
concerned, but it acts more or less as an outside compelling
force in the case of every one. Moreover our selves
are composite as well as wholes, and parts of us are
active in forming the general will, parts acquiesce and
parts are overborne. Thus it is clear that a general
tendency to progress in the human race may be well
established&mdash;as we hold it to be&mdash;and yet go on in
ways capable of infinite variation and at very various
speed. We are all, let us suppose, being carried onward
by one mighty and irresistible stream. We may combine
our strength and skill and make the best use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the surrounding forces. This is working and steering
to the chosen goal. Or we may rest on our oars and
let the stream take us where it will. This is drifting,
and we shall certainly be carried on somewhere;
but we may be badly bruised or even shipwrecked in
the process, and in any case we shall have contributed
nothing to the advance. Some few may even waste their
strength in trying to work backwards against the stream.
We seem to have reached the point in history when for
the first time we are really conscious of our position, and
the problem is now a possible and an urgent one to mark
the goal clearly and unitedly and bend our common efforts
to attaining it.</p>

<p>If this be so, the work of synthesis may be thought to
have a higher practical value for the moment than the
analysis which has prevailed in European thought for
the last forty or fifty years. In the earlier part of the nineteenth
century the great formative ideas which had been
gathering volume and enthusiasm during the revolutionary
period, took shape in complete systems of religious and
philosophic truth&mdash;Kant, Hegel, Spencer, Comte. They
have been followed by a period of criticism which has left
none of them whole, but on the other hand has produced
a mass of contradictions and specialisms highly confusing
and even hopeless to the public mind and veiling the more
important and profound agreements which have been
growing all the time beneath. There are now abundant
signs of a reaction towards unity and construction of
a broad and solid kind. In no respect is such a knitting
up more desirable than in this idea of progress itself.
Are we to say that there is no such thing as all-round
continuous progress, but only progress in definite branches
of thought and activity, progress in science or in particular
arts, social progress, physical progress, progress in popular
education and the like, but that any two or more branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
only coincide occasionally and by accident, and that
when working at one we can and should have no thought
of working at them all? This is no doubt a prevalent
view and we may hope that some things said in this book
may modify it. Another school of critical thinkers,
approaching the question from the point of view of the
ultimate object of action, asks what is the one thing for
which all others are to be pursued as means? Is increase
of knowledge the absolute good or increase of happiness?
Or if it is increase of love, is it quite indifferent what we
love? A few words on this may fitly conclude this
chapter.</p>

<p>The task of mankind, and of every one of us so far as
he is able to enter into it, is to bring together these
various aspects of human excellence, to see them as parts
of one ideal and labour to approach it. This approach is
progress, and if you say 'progress of what, and to what
end', the answer can only be, the progress of humanity,
and the end further progress. Some of the writers
in this book will indicate the point at which in their
view this progress is in contact with the infinite, with
something not given in history; but, whatever our
view of the transcendental problem may be, it is of
the utmost importance for all of us to realize that
we have given to us in the actual process of time, in
concrete history, a development of humanity, a growth
from a lower to a higher state of being, which may be
most perfectly realized in the individual consciousness,
fully awake and fully socialized, but is also clearly
traceable in the doings of the human race as a whole.
Such is in fact the uniting thread of these essays, and when
we proceed to the converse of this truth and apply this
ideal which we have shown to be the course of realization,
as a governing motive in our lives, it is even more
imperative to strive constantly to keep the whole to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>gether,
and not to regard either knowledge or power or
beauty or even love as an ultimate and supreme thing to
which all other ends are merely means. The end is a
more perfect man, developed by the perfecting of all
mankind.</p>

<p>Such a conception embraces all the separate aspects
of our nature each in its place, and each from its own angle
supreme. Love and knowledge inseparable and fundamental,
freedom and happiness essential conditions of
healthy growth, personality developed with the development
of the greater personality in which we all live and
grow. This greater personality is at its highest immeasurably
above us, and has no assignable limits in time or in
capacity to know, to love, or to enjoy. We cannot fix
its origin at any known point in the birth of planets,
nor does the cooling of our sun nor of all the suns seem
to put any limit in our imagination to the continuous
unfolding of life like our own. While thus practically
infinite, the ideal of human nature is revealed to us
concretely in countless types of goodness and truth and
beauty which we may know and love and imitate. To all
it is open to study the lineaments of this ideal in the
records and figures of the past; to most it is revealed in
some fellow beings known in life. From these, the human
spirits which embody the strivings, the hopes, the conquered
failings of the past, we may form our better selves
and build the humanity of the future.</p>

<p>There is a famous and magnificent passage in Dante's
<i>Purgatorio</i> which Catholic commentators interpret in
sacramental terms but we may well apply in a wider
sense to the progress of the human spirit towards the ideal.
It occurs at that crucial point where the ascending poet
leaves the circles of sad repentance to reach the higher
regions of growing light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'And when we came there, to the first step, it was of
white marble, so polished that I could see myself just
as I am.</p>

<p>'And the second was coloured dark, a rugged stone,
cracked lengthwise and across. And the third piled above
it was flaming porphyry, red like the blood from a vein.</p>

<p>'Above this one was the angel of God, sitting on the
threshold, bright as a diamond.</p>

<p>'Up the three steps my master led me with goodwill
and then he said, "Beg humbly that he unlock the door."'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p>Like this, the path man has to tread is not an easy
progress. But he is rising all the time and he rises on
steps of his own past. He sees reflected in them the image
of himself, and he sees too the deep faults in his nature,
and the rough surface of his path through time. The last
step, tinged by his own blood, gives access to a higher
dwelling, firm and bright and leading higher still. But
it is open only after a long ascent, and to the human
spirit that has worked faithfully, with love for his comrades
and leaders, and reverence for the laws which bind
both the world and him.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN PREHISTORIC TIMES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">R. R. Marett</span></h3>


<p>If I am unable to deliver this lecture in person, it will
be because I have to attend in Jersey to the excavation
of a cave once occupied by men of the Glacial Epoch.
Now these men knew how to keep a good fire burning
within their primitive shelter; their skill in the chase
provided them with a well-assorted larder; their fine
strong teeth were such as to make short work of their
meals; lastly, they were clever artisans and one may even
say artists in flint and greenstone, not only having the
intelligence to make an economic use of the material at
their disposal, but likewise having enough sense of form
to endow their implements with more than a touch of
symmetry and beauty. All this we know from what they
have left behind them; and the rest is silence.</p>

<p>And now let us imagine ourselves possessed of one of
those time-machines of which Mr. H. G. Wells is the
inventor. Transported by such means to the Europe of
that distant past, could we undertake to beat the record
of those cave-men?</p>

<p>Clearly, all will depend on how many of us, and how
much of the apparatus of civilization, our time-machine
is able to accommodate. If it were simply to drop a pair
of us, naked and presumably ashamed, into the midst of
the rigours of the great Ice Age, the chances surely are
that the unfortunate immigrants must perish within a
week. Adam could hardly manage to kindle a fire without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the help of matches. Eve would be no less sorely troubled
to make clothes without the help of a needle. On the
other hand, if the time-machine were as capacious as
Noah's Ark, the venture would undoubtedly succeed,
presenting no greater difficulty than, let us say, the
planting of a settlement in Labrador or on the Yukon.
Given numbers, specialized labour, tools, weapons, books,
domesticated animals and plants, and so forth, the civilized
community would do more than hold its own with
the prehistoric cave-man, devoid of all such aids to life.
Indeed, it is tolerably certain that, willingly or unwillingly,
our colonists would soon drive the ancient type of man
clean out of existence.</p>

<p>On the face of it, then, it would seem that we, as
compared with men of Glacial times, have decidedly
'progressed'. But it is not so easy to say off-hand in
what precisely such progress consists.</p>

<p>Are we happier? As well ask whether the wild wolf
or the tame dog is the happier animal. The truth would
seem to be that wolf and dog alike can be thoroughly
happy each in its own way; whereas each would be as
thoroughly miserable, if forced to live the life of the
other. In one of his most brilliant passages Andrew
Lang, after contrasting the mental condition of one of
our most distant ancestors with yours or mine, by no
means to our disadvantage, concludes with these words:
'And after all he was probably as happy as we are; it
is not saying much.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But, if not happier, are we nobler? If I may venture
to speak as a philosopher, I should reply, confidently,
'Yes.' It comes to this, that we have and enjoy more
soul. On the intellectual side, we see farther afield. On
the moral side, our sympathies are correspondingly wider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Imaginatively, and even to no small extent practically,
we are in touch with myriads of men, present and past.
We participate in a world-soul; and by so doing are
advanced in the scale of spiritual worth and dignity as
members of the human race. Yet this common soul of
mankind we know largely and even chiefly as something
divided against itself. Not only do human ideals contradict
each other; but the ideal in any and all of its forms
is contradicted by the actual. So it is the discontent
of the human world-soul that is mainly borne in upon him
who shares in it most fully. A possibility of completed
good may glimmer at the far end of the quest; but the
quest itself is experienced as a bitter striving. Bitter
though it may be, however, it is likewise ennobling. Here,
then, I find the philosophic, that is, the ultimate and truest,
touchstone of human progress, namely, in the capacity
for that ennobling form of experience whereby we become
conscious co-workers and co-helpers in an age-long,
world-wide striving after the good.</p>

<p>But to-day I come before you, not primarily as a philosopher,
but rather as an anthropologist, a student of
prehistoric man. I must therefore define progress, not
in the philosophic or ultimate way, but simply as may
serve the strictly limited aims of my special science. As
an anthropologist, I want a workable definition&mdash;one
that will set me working and keep me working on promising
lines. I do not ask ultimate truth of my anthropological
definition. For my science deals with but a single aspect
of reality; and the other aspects of the real must likewise
be considered on their merits before a final account
can be rendered of it.</p>

<p>Now anthropology is just the scientific history of man;
and I suppose that there could be a history of man that
did without the idea of human progress altogether.
Progress means, in some sense, change for the better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
But, strictly, history as such deals with fact; and is not
concerned with questions of better or worse&mdash;in a word,
with value. Hence, it must always be somewhat arbitrary
on the part of an historian to identify change in a given
direction with a gain or increase in value. Nevertheless,
the anthropologist may do so, if he be prepared to take
the risk. He sees that human life has on the whole
grown more complex. He cannot be sure that it will
continue to grow more complex. Much less has he a right
to lay it down for certain that it ought to grow more
complex. But so long as he realizes that he is thereby
committing himself by implication to a prophetic and
purposive interpretation of the facts, he need not hesitate
to style this growth of complexity progress so far as man
is concerned. For if he is an anthropologist, he is also
a man, and cannot afford to take a wholly external and
impartial view of the process whereby the very growth of
his science is itself explained. Anthropologists though we
be, we run with the other runners in the race of life, and
cannot be indifferent to the prize to be won.</p>

<p>Progress, then, according to the anthropologist, is
defined as increase in complexity, with the tacit assumption
that this somehow implies betterment, though it is
left with the philosopher to justify such an assumption
finally and fully. Whereas in most cases man would seem
to have succeeded in the struggle for existence by growing
more complex, though in some cases survival has been
secured by way of simplification, anthropology concentrates
its attention on the former set of cases as the more
interesting and instructive even from a theoretical point
of view. Let biology by all means dispense with the
notion of progress, and consider man along with the other
forms of life as subject to mere process. But anthropology,
though in a way it is a branch of biology, has a right to
a special point of view. For it employs special methods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
involving the use of a self-knowledge that in respect to
the other forms of life is inevitably wanting. Anthropology,
in short, like charity, begins at home. Because
we know in ourselves the will to progress, we go on to
seek for evidences of progress in the history of mankind.
Nor need we cease to think of progress as something to
be willed, something that concerns the inner man, even
though for scientific purposes we undertake to recognize
it by some external sign, as, for instance, by the sign of
an increasing complexity, that is, such differentiation as
likewise involves greater cohesion. All history, and more
especially the history of early man, must deal primarily
with externals. Thence it infers the inner life; and
thereby it controls the tendency known as 'the psychologist's
fallacy', namely, that of reading one's own mind
into that of another man without making due allowance
for differences of innate capacity and of acquired outlook.
In what follows, then, let us, as anthropologists, be content
to judge human progress in prehistoric times primarily
by its external and objective manifestations; yet let us
at no point in our inquiries forget that these ancient men,
some of whom are our actual ancestors, were not only
flesh of our flesh, but likewise spirit of our spirit.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A rapid sketch such as this must take for granted on
the part of the audience some general acquaintance with
that succession of prehistoric epochs which modern
research has definitely established. Pre-history, as distinguished
from proto-history, may, in reference to Europe
as a whole, be made coextensive with the Stone Age.
This divides into the Old Stone Age and the New. The
Old Stone Age, or Palaeolithic Period, yields three well-marked
subdivisions, termed Early, Middle, and Late.
The New Stone Age, or Neolithic Period, includes two
sub-periods, the Earlier or Transitional, and the Later or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Typical. Thus our historical survey will fall naturally
into five chapters.</p>

<p>There are reasons, however, why it will be more convenient
to move over the whole ground twice. The material
on which our judgements must be founded is not all of
one kind. Anthropology is the joint work of two departments,
which are known as Physical Anthropology and
Cultural Anthropology respectively. The former, we may
say, deals with man as an organism, the latter with him
as an organizer. Here, then, are very different standpoints.
For, in a broad way of speaking, nature controls man
through his physical organization, whereas through his
cultural organization man controls nature. From each
of these standpoints in turn, then, let us inquire how far
prehistoric man can be shown to have progressed. First,
did the breed improve during the long course of the
Stone Age in Europe? Secondly, did the arts of life
advance, so that by their aid man might establish himself
more firmly in his kingdom?</p>

<p>Did the breed improve during prehistoric times? I
have said that, broadly speaking, nature controls man as
regards his physical endowment. Now in theory one must
admit that it might be otherwise. If Eugenics were to
mature on its purely scientific side, there is no reason why
the legislator of the future should not try to make a practical
application of its principles; and the chances are
that, of many experiments, some would prove successful.
But that conscious breeding was practised in prehistoric
times is out of the question. The men of those days
were one and all what we are ourselves&mdash;nature's mongrels,
now broken up into varieties by casual isolation, and now
by no less casual intermixture recompounded in a host
of relatively unstable forms. Whatever progress, therefore,
may have occurred in this respect has been unconscious.
Man cannot take the credit for it, except in so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
far as it is indirectly due to that increase and spread
of the race which have been promoted by his achievements
in the way of culture.</p>

<p>The barest outline of the facts must suffice. For the
Early Pleistocene, apart from the Java fossil, <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i>, a veritable 'missing link', whom we may
here disregard as falling altogether outside our world of
Europe, there are only two individuals that can with
certainty be referred to this distant period. These are
the Piltdown and the Heidelberg specimens. The former
consists of a fragmentary brain-case, thick-boned and
narrow-fronted, but typically human in its general
characters, and of the greater part of a lower jaw, which,
as regards both its own elongated and curiously flanged
structure, and that of the teeth it contained, including
an enormous pointed canine, is conversely more appropriate
to an ape-like being than to a man. The latter
consists only of a lower jaw, of which the teeth, even the
canines, are altogether human, whereas the jaw itself is
hardly less simian than that of the Sussex skull. If we
add the Java example to the list of very primitive forms,
it is remarkable to note how, though differing widely
from each other, all alike converge on the ape. Nevertheless,
even in Pithecanthropus, the brute is passing into the
man. We note the erect attitude, to be inferred from his
thigh-bone, and the considerably enlarged, though even
so hardly human, brain. The Piltdown individual, on the
other hand, has crossed the Rubicon. He has a brain-capacity
entitling him to rank as a man and an Englishman.
Such a brain, too, implies a cunning hand, which
doubtless helped him greatly to procure his food, even if
his massive jaw enabled him to dispose of the food in
question without recourse to the adventitious aids of
knife and fork. For the matter of that, if our knowledge
made it possible to correlate these rare finds of bones more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
exactly with the innumerable flint implements ascribable
to this period (and, indeed, not without analogies among
the spoil from the Piltdown gravels), it might turn out
that even the equivalent of knife and fork was not
wanting to the Early Pleistocene supper-party, or, at any
rate, that the human hand was already advanced from the
status of labourer to the more dignified position of superintendent
of the tool.</p>

<p>The Middle Pleistocene Epoch belongs to the men of
the Neanderthal type. Some thirty specimens, a few
of them more or less complete, have come down to us,
and we can form a pretty clear notion of the physical
appearance of the race. Speaking generally, we may say
that it marks a stage of progress as compared with the
Piltdown type; though, if the jaw, heavy and relatively
chinless as it is, has become less simian, the protruding
brow-ridge lends a monstrous look to the face, while the
forehead is markedly receding&mdash;a feature which turns
out, however, to be not incompatible with a weight of
brain closely approaching our own average. Whether
this type has disappeared altogether from the earth, or
survives in certain much modified descendants, is an
open question. The fact remains that during the last
throes of the Glacial Epoch this rough-hewn kind of man
apparently had Northern Europe as his exclusive province;
and it is by no means evident what <i>Homo Sapiens</i>, the
supposed highly superior counterpart and rival of <i>Homo
Neanderthalensis</i>, was doing with himself in the meantime.
Moreover, not only in respect of space does the population
of that frozen world show remarkable homogeneity; but
also in respect of time must we allow it an undisputed
sway extending over thousands of years, during which
the race bred true. The rate of progress, whether reckoned
in physical terms or otherwise, is so slow as to be almost
imperceptible. A type suffices for an age. Whereas in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the life-history of an individual there is rapid development
during youth, and after maturity a steadying
down, it is the other way about in the life-history of the
race. Man, so to speak, was born old and accommodated
to a jog-trot. We moderns are the juveniles, and it is
left for us to go the pace.</p>

<p>Yet Late Pleistocene Period introduces us to more
diversity in the way of human types. Only one race,
however, that named after the rock-shelter of Cr&ocirc;-Magnon
in the Dordogne, is represented by a fair number of
specimens, namely, about a dozen. At this point we come
suddenly and without previous warning on as pretty
a kind of man as ever walked this earth. In his leading
characters he is remarkably uniform. Six feet high and
long-legged, he likewise possessed a head well stocked
with brains and a face that, if rather broad and short, was
furnished by way of compensation with a long and narrow
nose. If the present world can show nothing quite like
him, it at least cannot produce anything more shapely
in the way of the 'human form divine'. Apart from the
Cr&ocirc;-Magnons, the remains of an old woman and a youth
found at the lowest level of the Grotte des Enfants at
Mentone are usually held to belong to a distinct stock
known as the Grimaldi. The physical characters of the
pair are regarded as negroid, verging on the Pygmy;
but if we could study an adult male of the same stock,
it might possibly turn out not to be so very divergent
from the Cr&ocirc;-Magnon. Again, a single specimen does
duty for the so-called Chancelade race. The skeleton is
of comparatively low stature, and is deemed to show
close affinities to the type of the modern Eskimo. Without
being unduly sceptical, one may once more wonder if
the Cr&ocirc;-Magnon stock may not have produced this somewhat
aberrant form. Even on such a theory, however&mdash;and
it is hardly orthodox&mdash;diversity of physical structure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
would seem to be on the increase. On the other hand,
there are reasons of considerable cogency for referring
to the end of this period skeletons of what Huxley termed
the 'River-bed type', the peculiarity of which consists
in the fact that they are more or less indistinguishable
from the later Neolithic men and indeed from any of
those slight-built, shortish, long-headed folk who form
the majority in the crowded cities of to-day. Some
authorities would ascribe a far greater antiquity to this
type, but, I venture to think, on the strength of doubtful
evidence. The notorious Galley Hill skeleton, for instance,
found more or less intact in an Early Pleistocene bed in
which the truly contemporary animals are represented by
the merest battered remnants, to my mind reeks of
modernity. Be these things as they may, however,
when we come to Neolithic times a race of similar physical
characters has Europe to itself, though it would seem to
display minor variations in a way that suggests that the
reign of the mongrel has at length begun. And here we
may close our enumeration of the earliest known branches
of our family tree, since the coming of the broad-heads
pertains to the history of the Bronze Age, and hence
falls outside the scope of the present survey.</p>

<p>Now what is the bearing of these somewhat scanty
data on the question of progress? It is not easy to extract
from them more than the general impression that, as
time went on, the breed made persistent headway as
regards both the complexity of its organization and the
profusion of its forms. After all, we must not expect
too much from this department of the subject. For one
thing, beyond the limits of North-western Europe the
record is almost blank; and yet we can scarcely hope
to discover the central breeding-place of man in what is,
geographically, little more than a blind alley. In the next
place, Physical Anthropology, not only in respect to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
human palaeontology, but in general, is as barren of
explanations as it is fertile in detailed observations. The
systematic study of heredity as it bears on the history
of the human organism has hardly begun. Hence, it
would not befit one who is no expert in relation to such
matters to anticipate the verdict of a science that needs
only public encouragement in order to come into its own.
Suffice it to suggest here that nature as she presides over
organic evolution, that is, the unfolding of the germinal
powers, may be conceived as a kindly but slow-going and
cautious liberator. One by one new powers, hitherto
latent, are set free as an appropriate field of exercise is
afforded them by the environment. At first divergency
is rarely tolerated. A given type is extremely uniform.
On the other hand, when divergency is permitted, it
counts for a great deal. The wider variations occur nearest
the beginning, each for a long time breeding true to itself.
Later on, such uncompromising plurality gives way to
a more diffused multiplicity begotten of intermixture.
Mongrelization has set in. Not but what there may
spring up many true-breeding varieties among the
mongrels; and these, given suitable conditions, will
be allowed to constitute lesser types possessed of fairly
uniform characters. Such at least is in barest outline
the picture presented by the known facts concerning the
physical evolution of man, if one observe it from outside
without attempting to explore the hidden causes of the
process. Some day, when these causes are better understood,
man may take a hand in the game, and become,
in regard to the infinite possibilities still sleeping in the
transmitted germ, a self-liberator. Nature is but a
figurative expression for the chances of life, and the wise
man faces no more chances than he needs must. Scientific
breeding is no mere application of the multiplication table
to a system of items. We must make resolutely for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
types that seem healthy and capable, suppressing the
defectives in a no less thorough, if decidedly more considerate,
way than nature has been left to do in the past.
Here, then, along physical lines is one possible path of
human progress, none the less real because hitherto
pursued, not by the aid of eyes that can look and choose,
but merely in response to painful proddings at the
tail-end.</p>

<p>Our remaining task is to take stock of that improvement
in the arts of life whereby man has come gradually to
master an environment that formerly mastered him. For
the Early Palaeolithic Period our evidence in respect
of its variety, if not of its gross quantity, is wofully
disappointing. Not to speak of man's first and rudest
experiments in the utilization of stone, which are doubtless
scattered about the world in goodly numbers if only we
could recognize them clearly for what they are, the
Chellean industry by its wide distribution leads one to
suppose that mankind in those far-off days was only
capable of one idea at a time&mdash;a time, too, that lasted
a whole age. Yet the succeeding Acheulean style of workmanship
in flint testifies to the occurrence of progress
in one of its typical forms, namely, in the form of what
may be termed 'intensive' progress. The other typical
form I might call 'intrusive' progress, as happens when
a stimulating influence is introduced from without. Now
it may be that the Acheulean culture came into being
as a result of contact between an immigrant stock and
a previous population practising the Chellean method
of stone-work. We are at present far too ill-informed to
rule out such a guess. But, on the face of it, the greater
refinement of the Acheulean handiwork looks as if it
had been literally hammered out by steadfastly following
up the Chellean pattern into its further possibilities.
Explain it as we will, this evolution of the so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>coup-de-poing</i> affords almost the sole proof that the
human world of that remote epoch was moving at all.
If we could see their work in wood, we might discern
a more diversified skill or we might not. As it is, we can
but conclude in the light of our very imperfect knowledge
that in mind no less than in body mankind of Early
Palaeolithic times displayed a fixity of type almost
amounting to that of one of the other animal species.</p>

<p>During Middle Palaeolithic times the Mousterian
culture rules without a rival. The cave-period has begun;
and, thanks to the preservation of sundry dwelling-places
together with a goodly assortment of their less
perishable contents, we can frame a fairly adequate
notion of the home-life of Neanderthal man. I have
already alluded to my excavations in Jersey, and need
not enter into fuller details here. But I should like to
put on record the opinion borne in upon me by such
first-hand experience as I have had that cultural advance
in Mousterian days was almost as portentously slow as
ever it had been before. The human deposits in the
Jersey cave are in some places about ten feet thick, and
the fact that they fall into two strata separated by a sterile
layer that appears to consist of the dust of centuries
points to a very long process of accumulation. Yet
though there is one kind of elephant occurring amid the
bone refuse at the bottom of the bed, and another and,
it would seem, later kind at the top, one and the same
type of flint instrument is found at every level alike;
and the only development one can detect is a certain gain
in elegance as regards the Mousterian 'point', the reigning
substitute for the former <i>coup-de-poing</i>. Once more there
is intensive progress only, so far at least as most of the
Jersey evidence goes. One <i>coup-de-poing</i>, however, and
that hardly Acheulean in conception but exactly what
a hand accustomed to the fashioning of the Mousterian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
'point' would be likely to make by way of an imitation
of the once fashionable pattern, lay at lowest floor-level;
as if to remind one that during periods of transition the
old is likely to survive by the side of the new, and may
even survive in it as a modifying element. As a matter
of fact, the <i>coup-de-poing</i> is frequent in the earliest
Mousterian sites; so that we cannot but ask ourselves
how it came to be in the end superseded. Whether the
Mousterians were of a different race from the Acheuleans
is not known. Certain it is, on the other hand, that the
industry that makes its first appearance in their train
represents a labour-saving device. The Mousterian had
learned how to break up his flint-nodule into flakes,
which simply needed to be trimmed on one face to yield
a cutting edge. The Acheulean had been content to
attain this result more laboriously by pecking a
pebble on both faces until what remained was sharp
enough for his purpose. Here, then, we are confronted
with that supreme condition of progress, the inventor's
happy thought. One of those big-brained Neanderthal
men, we may suppose, had genius; nature, the liberator,
having released some latent power in the racial constitution.
Given such a culture-hero, the common herd was
capable of carrying on more or less mechanically for an
aeon or so. And so it must ever be. The world had better
make the most of its geniuses; for they amount to no
more than perhaps a single one in a million. Anyway,
Neanderthal man never produced a second genius, so far
as we can tell; and that is why, perhaps, his peculiar
type of brow-ridge no longer adorns the children of
men.</p>

<p>Before we leave the Mousterians, another side of their
culture deserves brief mention. Not only did they provide
their dead with rude graves, but they likewise furnished
them with implements and food for use in a future life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Herein surely we may perceive the dawn of what I do not
hesitate to term religion. A distinguished scholar and
poet did indeed once ask me whether the Mousterians,
when they performed these rites, did not merely show
themselves unable to grasp the fact that the dead are
dead. But I presume that my friend was jesting. A
sympathy stronger than death, overriding its grisly terror,
and converting it into the vehicle of a larger hope&mdash;that
is the work of soul; and to develop soul is progress.
A religious animal is no brute, but a real man with the
seed of genuine progress in him. If Neanderthal man
belonged to another species, as the experts mostly declare
and I very humbly beg leave to doubt, we must even so
allow that God made him also after his own image,
brow-ridges and all.</p>

<p>The presence of soul in man is even more manifest
when we pass on to the Late Palaeolithic peoples. They
are cave-dwellers; they live by the chase; in a word,
they are savages still. But they exhibit a taste and a
talent for the fine arts of drawing and carving that, as
it were, enlarge human existence by a new dimension.
Again a fresh power has been released, and one in which
many would seem to have participated; for good artists
are as plentiful during this epoch as ever they were in
ancient Athens or mediaeval Florence. They must have
married-in somewhat closely, one would think, for this
special aptitude to have blossomed forth so luxuriantly.
I cannot here dwell at length on the triumphs of Aurignacian
and Magdalenian artistry. Indeed, what I have seen
with my own eyes on the walls of certain French caves
is almost too wonderful to be described. The simplicity
of the style does not in the least detract from the fullness
of the charm. On the contrary, one is tempted to doubt
whether the criterion of complexity applies here&mdash;whether,
in fact, progress has any meaning in relation to fine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>art&mdash;since,
whether attained by simple or by complex means,
beauty is always beauty, and cannot further be perfected.
Shall we say, then, with Plato that beauty was revealed
to man from the first in its absolute nature, so that the
human soul might be encouraged to seek for the real in
its complementary forms of truth and goodness, such as
are less immediately manifest? For the rest, the soul
of these transcendently endowed savages was in other
respects more imperfectly illuminated; as may be
gathered from the fact that they carved and drew partly
from the love of their art, but partly also, and, perhaps,
even primarily, for luck. It seems that these delineations
of the animals on which they lived were intended to help
them towards good hunting. Such is certainly the object
of a like custom on the part of the Australian aborigines;
there being this difference, however, that the art of the
latter considered as art is wholly inferior. Now we know
enough about the soul of the Australian native, thanks
largely to the penetrating interpretations of Sir Baldwin
Spencer, to greet and honour in him the potential lord
of the universe, the harbinger of the scientific control
of nature. It is more than half the battle to have willed
the victory; and the picture-charm as a piece of moral
apparatus is therefore worthy of our deepest respect.
The chariot of progress, of which the will of man is the
driver, is drawn by two steeds, namely, Imagination and
Reason harnessed together. Of the pair, Reason is the
more sluggish, though serviceable enough for the heavy
work. Imagination, full of fire as it is, must always set
the pace. So the soul of the Late Palaeolithic hunter,
having already in imagination controlled the useful
portion of the animal world, was more than half-way
on the road to its domestication. But in so far as he mistook
the will for the accomplished deed, he was not getting
the value out of his second horse; or, to drop metaphor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the scientific reason as yet lay dormant in his soul. But
his dream was to come true presently.</p>

<p>The Neolithic Period marks the first appearance of the
'cibi-cultural' peoples. The food-seekers have become
food-raisers. But the change did not come all at once.
The earlier Neolithic culture is at best transitional. There
may even have been one of those set-backs in culture
which we are apt to ignore when we are narrating the
proud tale of human advance. Europe had now finally
escaped from the last ravages of an Arctic climate;
but there was cruel demolition to make good, and in
the meantime there would seem, as regards man, to have
been little doing. Life among the kitchen-middens of
Denmark was sordid; and the Azilians who pushed up
from Spain as far as Scotland did not exactly step into
a paradise ready-made. Somewhere, however, in the
far south-east a higher culture was brewing. By steps
that have not yet been accurately traced legions of
herdsmen and farmer-folk overspread our world, either
absorbing or driving before them the roving hunters
of the older dispensation. We term this, the earliest of
true civilizations, 'neolithic', as if it mattered in the
least whether your stone implement be chipped or polished
to an edge. The real source of increased power and
prosperity lay in the domestication of food-animals and
food-plants. The man certainly had genius and pluck
into the bargain who first trusted himself to the back of
an unbroken horse. It needed hardly less genius to
discover that it is no use singing charms over the seed-bearing
grass in order to make it grow, unless some of
the seed is saved to be sowed in due season. Society
possibly brained the inventor&mdash;such is the way of the
crowd; but, as it duly pocketed the invention, we have
perhaps no special cause to complain.</p>

<p>By way of appreciating the conditions prevailing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the Later Neolithic Age, let us consider in turn the Lake-dwellers
of Switzerland and the Dolmen-builders of our
Western coast-lands. I was privileged to assist, on the
shore of the Lake of Neuch&acirc;tel, in the excavation of a site
where one Neolithic village of pile-dwellings had evidently
been destroyed by fire, and at some later date, just falling
within the Stone Age, had been replaced by another.
Here we had lighted on a crucial instance of the march
of cultural progress. The very piles testified to it, those
of the older settlement being ill-assorted and slight,
whereas the later structure was regularly built and
heavily timbered. It was clear, too, that the first set
of inhabitants had lived narrow lives. All their worldly
goods were derived from strictly local sources. On the
other hand, their successors wore shells from the Mediterranean
and amber beads from the Baltic among their
numerous decorations; while for their flint they actually
went as far afield as Grand Pressigny in West-Central
France, the mines of which provided the butter-like
nodules that represented the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Neolithic
luxury. Commerce must have been decidedly flourishing
in those days. No longer was it a case of the so-called
'silent trade', which the furtive savage prosecutes with
fear and trembling, placing, let us say, a lump of venison
on a rock in the stream dividing his haunts from those
of his dangerous neighbours, and stealing back later on
to see if the red ochre for which he pines has been deposited
in return on the primitive counter. The Neolithic trader,
on the other side, must have pushed the science of barter
to the uttermost limits short of the invention of a circulating
medium, if indeed some crude form of currency was
not already in vogue.</p>

<p>When we turn to the Dolmen-builders, and contemplate
their hoary sanctuaries, we are back among the problems
raised by the philosophic conception of progress as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
advance in soul-power. Is any religion better than none?
Does it make for soul-power to be preoccupied with the
cult of the dead? Does the imagination, which in alliance
with the scientific reason achieves such conquests over
nature, give way at times to morbid aberration, causing
the chill and foggy loom of an after-life to obscure the
honest face of the day? I can only say for myself that
the deepening of the human consciousnesses due to the
effort to close with the mystery of evil and death, and to
extort therefrom a message of hope and comfort, seems
to me to have been worth the achievement at almost any
cost of crimes and follies perpetrated by the way. I do
not think that progress in religion is progress towards its
ultimate abolition. Rather, religion, if regarded in the
light of its earlier history, must be treated as the parent
source of all the more spiritual activities of man; and
on these his material activities must depend. Else the
machine will surely grind the man to death; and his
body will finally stop the wheels that his soul originally
set in motion.</p>

<p>The panorama is over. It has not been easy, at the
rate of about a millennium to a minute, to present
a coherent account of the prehistoric record, which at
best is like a jig-saw puzzle that has lost most of the
pieces needed to reconstitute the design. But, even
on this hasty showing, it looks as if the progressive nature
of man were beyond question. There is manifest gain in
complexity of organization, both physical and cultural;
and only less manifest, in the sense that the inwardness of
the process cannot make appeal to the eye, is the corresponding
gain in realized power of soul. In short, the men
of the Stone Age assuredly bore their full share in the
work of race-improvement; and the only point on which
there may seem to be doubt is whether we of the age of
metal are as ready and able to bear our share. But let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
us be optimistic about ourselves. As long as we do not
allow our material achievements to blind us to the need
of an education that keeps the spiritual well to the fore,
then progress is assured so far as it depends on culture.</p>

<p>Yet if we could likewise breed for spirituality, humanity's
chances, I believe, would be bettered by as much
again or more. But how is this to be done? Science
must somehow find out. To leave it to nature is treason
to the mind. Man may be an ass on the whole, but nature
is even more of an ass, especially when it stands for human
nature minus its saving grace of imaginative, will-directed
intelligence. So let us hope that one day people will
marry intelligently, and that the best marriages will be
the richest in offspring. I believe that the spiritual is
not born of the sickly; and at any rate should be prepared
to make trial of such a working principle in my New
Republic.</p>

<p>So much for the practical corollaries suggested by our
flying visit to Prehistoric Europe. But, even if any
detailed lessons to be drawn from such fragmentary
facts have to be received with caution, you need not
hesitate to pursue this branch of study for its own sake
as part of the general training of the mind. Accustom
yourselves to a long perspective. Cultivate the eagle's
faculty of spacious vision. It is only thus that one can
get the values right&mdash;see right and wrong, truth and error,
beauty and ugliness in their broad and cumulative effects.
Analytic studies, as they are termed, involving the exploration
of the meaning of received ideas, must come first
in any scheme of genuine education. We must learn
to affirm before we can go on to learn how to criticize.
But historical studies are a necessary sequel. Other
people's received ideas turn out in the light of history
to have sometimes worked well, and sometimes not so
well; and we are thereupon led to revise our own opinions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
accordingly. Now the history of man has hitherto stood
almost exclusively for the history of European civilization.
Being so limited, it loses most of its value as an instrument
of criticism. For how can a single phase of culture
criticize itself? How can it step out of the scales and
assess its own weight? Anthropology, however, will
never acquiesce in this parochial view of the province
of history. History worthy of the name must deal with
man universal. So I would have you all become anthropologists.
Let your survey of human progress be age-long
and world-wide. You come of a large family and an
ancient one. Learn to be proud of it, and then you will
seek likewise to be worthy of it.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS AND HELLENISM</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">F. Melian Stawell</span></h3>


<p>To speak the truth about national characteristics it is
often necessary to speak in paradoxes, for of all unities
on earth nothing contains so many contradictions as
a nation. So it is here: it may be said quite truly that
the Greeks had at once the most profound conceptions
about Progress and no faith in it: that they were at once
the most hopeful and the most despairing of peoples.
Let me try to explain. When we speak of a faith in
Progress, whatever else we mean, we must mean, I take
it, that there is a real advance in human welfare throughout
time from the Past to the Future, that 'the best is
yet to be', and that the good wine is kept to the last.
But if we are to have a philosophy underlying that faith
we must be able to say something more. What, in the
first place, do we mean by 'a real advance'? Or by
'human welfare'? Progress, yes, but progress towards
what? What is the standard? And if we cannot
indicate a standard, what right have we to say that one
life is any better than another? The life of the scientific
man any better than the life of the South Sea Islander&mdash;content
if only he has enough bananas to eat? Or than
the life of a triumphant conqueror, a Zenghis Khan or
a Tamberlaine&mdash;exultant if he has enough human heads
before him? Or, indeed, any of these rather than the
blank of Nirvana or the life of a vegetable?</p>

<p>Our first need, then, is the need of a standard for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
good over and above the conflicting opinions of men,
and some idea as to what that standard implies.</p>

<p>And the next question is, why we should hold that any
of this good is going to be realized in human life at all?
If it is, there must be some connexion of cause and effect
between goodness and human existence. What is the
nature of that connexion? Finally, why should we hope
that this goodness is realized more and more fully as time
goes on?</p>

<p>The Greeks faced these questions, as they faced so
many, with extraordinary daring and penetration and
with an intimate mixture of sadness and hope.</p>

<p>They themselves, of all nations known to us in history,
had made the greatest progress in the shortest space of
time. A long course of preparation, it is true, underlay
that marvellous growth. The classical Greeks,&mdash;and when
I speak of Hellenism I mean the flower of classical Greek
culture,&mdash;the classical Greeks entered into the labours
of the island peoples, who, whether kindred to them or
not, had built up from neolithic times a great civilization,
the major part of which they could, and did, assimilate.
They found the soil already worked. None the
less it is to their own original genius that we owe
those great discoveries of the spirit which, to quote
a recent writer, 'created a new world of science and art,
established an ideal of the sane mind in the sane body
and the perfect man in the perfect society, cut out a new
line of progress between anarchy and despotism, and
made moral ends supreme over national in the State.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>But these practical achievements of theirs have been
already summed up by Professor J. A. Smith in his lecture<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
at this school last year, and it is to that lecture that
I would refer you. I will take it as a basis and proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for my own purposes to discuss the Greek conceptions
about progress. Those conceptions were complex, and,
speaking roughly, we may say this: if belief in real
progress implies belief in three things, namely, (1) an
absolute standard apprehended, however dimly, by
man, (2) a causal connexion between existence and
perfection, and (3) a persistent advance through time,
then the Greeks held to the first two and doubted,
or even denied, the third. Their two great thinkers,
Plato and Aristotle, worked out systems based on the
conviction that there really was an absolute standard of
perfection, that man could really apprehend something
of this perfection, and that the effort towards it was
essential to the very existence of the world, part of the
stuff, as it were, that made the universe. These systems
have had an effect not to be exaggerated on the whole
movement of thought since their day. Moreover, many
of their fundamental conceptions are being revived in
modern science and metaphysics. And the convictions
that underlie them are calculated, one would say, to lead
at once to a buoyant faith in progress. But with Plato,
and Aristotle, and the Greeks generally, they did not so
lead. The Greeks could not feel sure that this effort
towards perfection, though it is part of existence, is strong
enough to deliver man in this world from the web of evil
in which also he is involved, nor even that he makes any
approach on the whole towards the loosening of the toils.
The spectre of world-destruction, as Whitman says of
Carlyle, was always before them. And I wish to ask
later on if we may not surmise definite reasons in their
own history for this recurring note of discouragement.
But let us first look at the positive side, and first in
Plato. Plato came to his system by several lines of
thought, and to understand it we ought to take account
of all.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>1. In the first place no thinker, I suppose, ever felt
more keenly than he felt the desire for an absolute
standard of truth, especially in matters of right and wrong,
if only to decide between the disputes of men. And, in
Greece men disputed so boldly and so incessantly that
there was no possibility of forgetting the clash of opinion
in any 'dogmatic slumber'. Thus Plato is always
asking, like Robert Browning in 'Rabbi Ben Ezra',&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Now, who shall arbitrate?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ten men love what I hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shun what I follow, slight what I receive;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ten who in ears and eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Match me: we all surmise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They this thing, and I that; whom shall my soul believe?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In one of his very earliest dialogues, the 'Euthyphro',
Plato puts the question almost in so many words. What is
it, he asks (7 <span class="smcap">a-e</span>), that men quarrel over most passionately
when they dispute? Is it not over the great questions
of justice and injustice, of beauty, goodness, and the
like? They do not quarrel thus over a question of
physical size, simply because they can settle such a dispute
by reference to an unquestioned standard, a standard
measure, let us say.</p>

<p>If there is no corresponding standard for right and
wrong, if each man is really the judge and the measure
for himself, then there is no sense, Plato feels, in claiming
that one man is wiser than another in conduct, or indeed
any man wiser than a dog-faced baboon (<i>Theaet.</i> 161 <span class="smcap">c-e</span>).</p>

<p>2. Again, Plato feels most poignantly the inadequacy
of all the goodness and beauty we have ever actually seen
in this world of space and time, compared with the ideal
we have of them in their perfection. How can we have
this sense of deficiency, he asks, unless somehow we
apprehend something supreme, over and above all the
approaches to it that have as yet appeared? (<i>Phaedo</i>,
74 <span class="smcap">e</span>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>This vision of an absolute perfection, as yet unrealized
on earth, so dominates all his thinking, and has such
peculiar features of its own, that even familiar quotations
must be quoted here. You will find an exquisite
translation of a typical passage in our Poet Laureate's
Anthology, <i>The Spirit of Man</i> (No. 37). Specially to be
noted here is the stress on the unchanging character of
this eternal perfection and the suggestion that it cannot
be fully realized in the world. At the same time, Plato
is equally sure that it is only through the study of this
world that our apprehension of that perfection is
awakened at all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'He who has thus been instructed in the science of Love,
and has been led to see beautiful things in their due order
and rank, when he comes toward the end of his discipline,
will suddenly catch sight of a wondrous thing, beautiful
with the absolute Beauty ... he will see a Beauty eternal,
not growing or decaying, not waxing or waning, nor will
it be fair here and foul there ... as if fair to some and foul
to others ... but Beauty absolute, separate, simple, and
everlasting; which lending of its virtue to all beautiful
things that we see born to decay, itself suffers neither
increase nor diminution, nor any other change' (<i>Symp.</i> 211).</p></div>

<p>All beautiful things remind man, Plato tells us in his
mythological fashion, of this perfect Beauty, because we
had seen it once before in another life, before our souls
were born into this world, 'that blissful sight and spectacle'
(<i>Phaedrus</i>, 250 <span class="smcap">b</span>) when we followed Zeus in his
winged car and all the company of the gods, and went out
into the realm beyond the sky, a realm 'of which no
mortal poet has ever sung or ever will sing worthily'.</p>

<p>3. But, beside this passion for the ideal, Plato was
intensely interested in our knowledge of the actual world
of appearances around us. And one of the prime questions
with which he was then concerned was the question,
what we mean when we talk about the nature or character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the things we see, a plant, say, or an animal, or a man.
We must mean something definite, otherwise we could
not recognize, for example, that a plant <i>is</i> a plant through
all its varieties and all the different stages of its growth.
Plato's answer was, that in all natural things there is
a definite principle that copies, as it were, a definite Type
or Form, and this Type he calls an Idea. Thus in some
sense it is this Type, this Idea, this Form, that brings the
particular thing into being.</p>

<p>4. But it was not enough for Plato to say that every
natural thing had in some sense a certain type for its basis,
unless he could believe that this type was good, and that
all the types were harmonious with each other. He could
only be satisfied with the world, in short, if he could feel
that it came about through a movement towards perfection.
He makes his Socrates say that in asking about
'the causes of things, what it is that makes each thing
come into being', it was not enough for him if he could
only see that the thing was there because something had
put it there: he also wanted to see that it was good for it
to be there. Socrates tells us that what he needed he
thought he had found in a book by Anaxagoras, which
announced 'that Mind was the disposer and cause of all'
because, 'I said to myself, If this be so&mdash;if Mind is the
orderer, it will have all in order, and put every single thing
in the place that is best for it'.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It is the same feeling as that which underlies the words
of Genesis about the Creation, 'And God saw that it was
good'. And there is no doubt that such a view of the
world would be supremely satisfying if we could count
it true. There may be considerable intellectual satisfaction,
no doubt, in merely solving a puzzle as to how
things come about, but it is as nothing compared to the
joy there would be in contemplating their goodness.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>5. But is it true? Can we possibly say so in view of the
hideous imperfection round us? The writers of Genesis
spoke of a Fall. Plato, in his own way, speaks of a
Fall himself. He never gives up the belief in an
Absolute Perfection, a system of Perfect Types somehow&mdash;he
does not say exactly how&mdash;influencing the
structure of things in this world. But he holds that on
earth this perfection is always thwarted by a medium
which prevents its full manifestation. This medium is
the medium of Space and Time, and therefore the medium
of history&mdash;and therefore history is always and inevitably
a record of failure. 'While we are in the body,' Plato
writes, 'and while the soul is contaminated with its
evils, our desire will never be thoroughly satisfied.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> 'The
body is a tomb,' he writes elsewhere, quoting a current
phrase.</p>

<p>This is sad enough: yet if we put against it Plato's
vision of what Man might be, we get as inspiring words
as ever were written:</p>

<p>'We have spoken of Man', he says at the end of the
<i>Republic</i>, 'as he appears to us now, but now he looks as
Glaucus looked after he had been cast into the sea, and
his original nature was scarcely to be discerned, for his
limbs were broken and crushed and defaced by the waters,
and strange things had grown round him, shells and
seaweed and stones, so that he was more like a beast than
a man. That is how the soul looks to us now encompassed
by all her evils. It is elsewhere, my friend, that we ought
to look.' Where? asks Plato's friend, and Plato answers,
'We should look to her love of wisdom and realize what
she clings to, what company she desires, for she is akin
to the Divine and Immortal and Eternal, and we should
understand what she would become if she followed after
it, with all her strength, and were lifted by that effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
out of the sea where she now lies.... Then we should
understand her real nature.' (<i>Republic</i>, 611.)</p>

<p>Somewhere, Plato believes, this true nature of man
may be realized. The Principle of Good is something
active, not a dead helpless thing, with no effect on the
rest of the universe (<i>Sophist</i>, 248, 249); it is a living power,
which desires that everything everywhere should be as
glorious as possible (<i>Tim.</i> 29 <span class="smcap">d</span>). There is no envy, Plato
says, in the Divine, that grudging spirit has no part in
the heavenly company. Only it is not on earth that the
glory can be realized. It is towards the life after death
that Plato's real hopes are directed.</p>

<p>None the less, and this is important, this world does
not cease to be significant for him. He does not turn
aside,&mdash;as some souls, intoxicated with the Divine, have
done,&mdash;from this world altogether.</p>

<p>Because he holds that man can only advance by
struggling to make this world better. Man's ordinary
life may be like the life in a cave, as he says in his famous
myth, but the true philosopher who has once risen out of
the cave must go back into it again and teach the prisoners
there what the universe really is (<i>Republic</i>, Book vi,
<i>fin.</i>; vii, <i>init.</i>). The very passage that I quoted about
man's real nature comes at the end of the <i>Republic</i>. Now
the <i>Republic</i> is a Utopia, and no one writes a Utopia
unless he believes that the effort to reach it is of prime
importance to man and helps him to advance.</p>

<p>Only, for Plato, the advance is not marked in the successive
stages of history, as the modern faith in progress
asserts. The life on earth, for Plato, is like a school
through which men pass and in which they may learn and
grow, but the school itself does not go on growing. It is
not that he does not envisage change in history, but what
he seems to hope for at the best is nothing more hopeful
than recurring cycles of better and worse. He tells a fable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in his dialogue 'The Statesman', of how at one time the
world is set spinning in the right direction by God and
then all goes well, and again how God ceases to control
it, and then it gradually forgets the divine teaching and
slips from good to bad and from bad to worse, until at
last God takes pity on it once more to save it from utter
destruction (<i>Polit.</i> 269 ff.). No doubt in this idea of
cycles Plato is influenced by the popular thought of his
time: this feeling that there had been a lost Golden Age
in the past was deeply rooted in Greek mythology. We
get it long before Plato, in Hesiod, and there are similar
touches in Homer, and once men believe that they have
sunk from glory, there is always the dread that if ever
they recover it they will lose it again. And with Plato
this dread is reinforced by his sense of something incurable
in the world, the thwarting influence of spatial and
temporal matter (<i>Theaet.</i> 176 <span class="smcap">a</span>).</p>

<p>It is strange that, though he is always thinking of the
individual soul as learning through experience in its
passage from one life to another, Plato does not seem to
have the idea of mankind learning by the lessons of
history, of knowledge being handed down from one age
to another, and growing in the process. That is one of
the most inspiring ideas in modern thought: a German
writer has spoken of history as the long Odyssey of the
human spirit, the common mind of Man coming at last
through its wanderings to find out what it really wants,
and where its true home lies.</p>

<p>And here, significantly enough, we find we are brought
back in our modern way to something very like Plato's
own conception of an eternal unchanging Reality. There
are endless problems in the whole conception of the
Eternal that I am quite unable even to attempt; but
this much at least seems clear to me, that the whole idea
of mankind learning by the experience of History, implies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
something of permanent value running through that
experience. The very thought of continued progress
implies that man can look back at the successive stages
of the Past and say of each: In that lay values which
I, to-day and always, can recognize as good, although
I believe we have more good now. Seeley speaks in a noble
passage of how religion might conceive a progressive
revelation which was, in a sense, the same through all its
stages, and yet was a growing thing:&mdash;'each new revelation
asserts its own superiority to those which went before,'
but the superiority is 'not of one thing to another thing&mdash;but
of the developed thing to the undeveloped'. 'It is
thus', he writes, 'that the ages should behave to one
another.' This is the true 'understanding and concert
with time'.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And though Plato does not live in the
thought of historic progress, yet such a conception of
progress which recognizes at different stages different
expressions, more or less adequate, of one eternal value,
such a way of thinking is entirely Platonic. When we
look back at history in this mood we think not only of
grasping the right principles for the Future, but of rejoicing
in the definite achievements of the Past, and we feel this
most poignantly, I think, of the achievements won by the
spirit of Beauty. Great works of Art we are accustomed
actually to call immortal, and we mean by this not
merely that we think they will always be famous, but that
there is something in them that makes it impossible for
them ever to be superseded. In themselves they are inexhaustible:
if they cease to interest us, it is our fault and
not theirs. We may want more, we do want more, where
they came from, but we never want to lose them, any more
than we could bear to lose our old friends, though we may
desire to make new ones. Of all the divine Ideas, said
Plato, Beauty is the one that shows itself most plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the world of sense and speaks to us most plainly of the
eternal realities.</p>

<p>This, however, is perhaps trenching on the subject of
Progress in Art, and I should like to return to the general
Greek conception of the tendency in all nature towards
the Good, the perfect realization of perfect types.</p>

<p>Plato does not expressly insist that this tendency is of
the nature of effort, though I think that is involved in his
view. But Aristotle does. Following Plato in essentials,
he makes bold to say outright that every natural thing
in its own way longs for the divine and desires to share
in the divine life, so far as it can.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Every such thing in
this world of space and time has to cope with difficulties
and is imperfect, but everything struggles towards the
good. That good is in the life of God, a thinking life, an
activity of thought, existing in some sense beyond this
imperfect world; and this life is so supremely desirable
that it makes everything else struggle to reach it. It
moves the whole world, Aristotle says, in a famous
passage, because it is loved. It is the world's desire.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Now this idea of effort&mdash;or of something analogous to
effort&mdash;constituting the inner nature of every natural
thing reappears, with pregnant consequences, in modern
thought, though seldom with these vast theological
consequences. The idea of an upward effort through
nature lies at the base of our most hopeful theories of
evolution, and forms the true support of our modern
faith in progress. Broadly speaking, our evolutionists
are now divided into two schools: the adherents of the
one believe that variations are purely accidental, and
may occur in any direction whatsoever, the useful ones
being preserved only because they happen to be useful for
the life of the species, while the adherents of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>other&mdash;the
school that I would call the school of hope&mdash;believe
that accident, even with natural selection to aid it, is
utterly inadequate to account for the ordered beauty and
harmony that we do see in natural things. They admit,
as Plato and Aristotle admit, imperfection and difficulty
in the world, but they insist on a movement towards
value: in short, they conceive an order emerging that is
brought about, to quote a modern writer, both in nature
and in society, by 'a principle of movement and progress
conflicting with a principle of inertia.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle, in words that are strikingly modern, raises
the very question at issue here.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He asks whether we can
suppose that nature does not aim at the good at all, but
that variations arise by chance and are preserved just
because they are useful, and he scouts the idea that
chance could do more, as Zeller says, than 'bring about
isolated and abnormal results'. He chooses instead the
conception of purpose and effort, and this in spite of the
difficulties in conceiving a purpose and an effort that are
not definitely conscious. The sort of thing that is in
Aristotle's mind when he speaks of nature aiming at the
good, comes out in a passage by Edward Carpenter in
his little book <i>The Art of Creation</i>. Carpenter plunges
boldly and compares the principle that makes a tree grow
and propagate its kind with the impulse that makes
a man express himself. Man, he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>has a Will and Purpose, a Character, which, do what you
will, tends to push outwards towards expression. You
put George Fox in prison, you flog and persecute him, but
the moment he has a chance he goes and preaches just
the same as before.... But take a Tree and you notice
exactly the same thing. A dominant Idea informs the
life of the Tree; persisting, it forms the tree. You may
snip the leaves as much as you like to a certain pattern,
but they will only grow in their own shape. Finally, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
may cut the tree down root and branch and burn it,
but, if there is left a single seed, within that seed ... lurks
the formative ideal, which under proper conditions will
again spring into life and expression.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>Aristotle would have endorsed almost every word of
this. In his pithy way, speaking of the distinction between
natural and artificial objects, he says himself that if you
planted a wooden bed and the wood could still grow, it
would grow up, not a bed, but a tree.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>He would not have gone so far as to talk about the
<i>Will</i> of a tree, but he would have admitted that what made
the tree grow was the same sort of thing as Will. And in
one respect he goes farther than Edward Carpenter does.
For he considers that not only growth but even the movement
of natural things through space is somehow an
expression of a tendency towards the good and the divine,
a tendency which, when consciousness supervenes, we can
call effort, an activity, even though, at its best, only
an imperfect activity. He looks up at the splendour of
the circling stars and asks if it is possible that so glorious
an order can be anything but a manifestation of something
akin to the divine. Here indeed he is speaking
of movements made by existences he reckoned among the
highest in the world, for he thought the stars were living
beings higher than man. But he recognized a rudimentary
form of such activity even in what we now call inanimate
matter. Here we come to a leading conception of Aristotle's,
and one most important for our purpose: the
conception of a hierarchy of natural existences, all of them
with some value, less or more. When Aristotle is truest
to himself, he will tell us not to be afraid of studying the
meanest forms of natural existence, because in everything
there is something marvellous and divine. He quotes
with much satisfaction the story of Heracleitus, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
welcomed his friends into the bakehouse with the saying
that 'there were gods in the bakehouse too'.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Thus, at the lowest end of the scale, we have what we
call inanimate matter, which Aristotle thinks of much as
we do, namely, as something occupying space, the different
parts of it being endowed with different powers of movement,
and with different properties, such as warmth or
coldness, wetness or dryness. A natural thing, he says,
is a thing that has a principle of activity in itself, something
that makes it act in a definite way, whenever it
is not interfered with by anything else.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Aristotle speaks,
for example, of fire having a natural tendency to mount
up, much as we might speak of solids having a natural
tendency to gravitate towards one another. Go back as
far as we like, and, Aristotle thinks, we still find certain
primitive differences which constitute what we call the
primitive elements. This, I imagine, is much the point
of view of modern science.</p>

<p>And these primitive elements in Aristotle's view
influence each other, unite with each other, or change
into each other. As a rule, however, they exhibit no
new powers. But given a happy concurrence of qualities,
say a certain union of heat and cold, and a new power
does become manifest: the power of life. Thus, in
a sense, Aristotle does envisage the spontaneous generation
of life; and he knows, roughly, what he means by
life. The living thing can go through far more changes
than the non-living, while yet remaining recognizably the
same thing. For example, it shows in itself a greater
advance to richness and also a decline, it uses other
things to foster this advance, and it sends out fresh
things, like itself, but independent of itself: in short, it
grows, decays, feeds itself, and propagates its kind.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p><p>As I understand Aristotle, for him there is not an entire
and absolute difference between ordinary matter and living
things, and yet there is a real difference, and one not to
be explained away, for there is a new manifestation of
active energy. And if we consider life of more value
than mere motion, then we are right in saying there is a
higher energy. The quality of growth is a quality which
could not be deduced from the quality of warmth or
from the quality of mere movement in space, and
yet all three qualities are alike in this, that they
are all manifestations of an energy which is somehow
inherent in things, and not merely imposed on them
from without. The manifestations of life are started,
in a sense, by the different movements, 'mechanical',
if you like to call them so, in the rudimentary forms of
matter, the elements meeting each other in space. The
process of life could not have begun without such movements.
But neither could it have begun if the elements,
just as they appear, had been all there was. There had
to be latent, that is, the possibility of a different and
higher mode of action. This higher mode of action
Aristotle calls a higher Form, a higher Idea. And
I think it is true to him to say that he believes the lower
Forms, the lower Ideas, do their most perfect work
when they bring about the conditions under which the
higher ones can operate. For when he speaks of that
concurrence of elements that conditions life he speaks
of the 'warmth and cold' as 'having mastered the
matter'.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In any case he conceives a whole series of higher and
lower Forms, the higher coming nearer and nearer to that
full and glorious activity which he conceives to be the
life of God. Above the power of the thing to grow as
a plant grows appears the power of sensation as it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
present in animals, and above that again the power,
first seen in man, of living the life of thought, perceiving
what is beautiful and true in the 'forms', the characters,
of all the things around him, and with this that further
power of setting consciously before himself what he really
wants to be and to do, the power of moral action strictly
so-called.</p>

<p>Throughout this series, in every higher stage the lower
is present as a kind of basis. In the man who thinks
there is active not only the power of thought, but also
the power of sensation, the faculty of growth, and the
physical properties of the body. It would seem that
Aristotle has only to take one step, and he would be a
thoroughgoing evolutionist. He has only to say that the
different stages are successive in time, the lower regularly
preceding the higher. But this step he hesitates to take.</p>

<p>He often comes very near it. He speaks of nature passing
gradually from inanimate things through living things
to living animals. He speaks of what is first in itself, first
inherently, 'prior' in the logical sense because it is the goal
and the completion of the thing, as appearing later in time.
For instance, he believes that man can only find his real
happiness and develop his real nature in the State, but
the State appears later in time than the primitive associations
of the household and the family.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> What came earlier
in history were barbarous communities such as those of the
Cyclopes, where 'each man laid down the law for his wife
and children and obeyed no other law'.</p>

<p>But Aristotle does not go on from this belief to the
belief in a universal upward process throughout all
history. The developed State, it is true, may always have
been preceded by a lower form, but that lower form may
itself have been preceded by a higher.</p>

<p>Aristotle, in short, is haunted, like Plato, by the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of cycles, alternations, decline and progress, progress and
decline. He feels this both in the life of States and in the
whole life of the world. He speaks of the same discoveries
being made over and over again, an infinite number of
times, in the history of civilization. And his words
recall the sad passage in Plato's <i>Laws</i> (676) referring to
the numberless nations and states, ten thousand times
ten thousand, that had risen and fallen all over the world,
passing from worse to better and from better to worse.
Similarly Aristotle will speak of degraded animal forms,
and sometimes write as though the animal world could
sink back into the vegetable altogether.</p>

<p>Admitting, however, something like progress within the
different cycles, we must ask a little more about the kind of
progress which Aristotle would have desired. (I take
Aristotle again as a typical Greek.) Man at his best, he
clearly holds, in trying to realize his true nature should aim
at a happiness which involves a harmony of all his faculties,
a harmony inspired and led by the highest faculty of all,
the Reason which rejoices in the contemplation of what
is at once true and good and beautiful.</p>

<p>Now in this aim, we must ask, does a man need other
men and other creatures, and in what sense does he need
them? Here, I think, we come on two inconsistent
tendencies in Aristotle's thought, connected with two
different ways of regarding the hierarchy of existences.
We say that one existence is higher than another. Does
this mean that what we call the lower are only so many
blundering attempts to reach the higher? That every
creature, for example, which is not a thinking man is, on
the whole, a mistake? Aristotle often does speak like that.
Woman, he says in one passage, is only a mutilated male.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The principle which ought to develop into the active
power of thought could not, he explains, in women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
master the recalcitrant element which is always thwarting
perfection, and thus woman is man <i>manqu&eacute;</i>. On these
lines of thought it is easy to slip into looking on all other
forms of existence as merely valuable in so far as they
serve the direct purposes of men, and indeed only of a few
men, those namely who are able to think as philosophers.
This is the kind of view according to which, as the satirist
suggests, cork-trees only grow in order to make corks
for champagne-bottles, and the inferior races of mankind
only exist to furnish slaves for the higher. And Aristotle
does, on occasion, lend himself to such a view: he
justifies a slavery in which, as he says, some men are to
be treated merely as living tools. And yet on his own
principles every man ought to aim at realizing his own
end, and not merely the ends of others.</p>

<p>But there is a widely different view, also present in
Aristotle, and truer to the essence of his thought. It is a
view instinct with that reverence for all existence of which
I spoke at first, and it holds that all the different natural
types, high or low, could all be united in one harmony,
like an ordered army, as Aristotle himself would say,
in which the divine spirit was present even as the spirit
of a general is present in his men. The greatest thing in
man, Aristotle thinks, is the godlike power of apprehending
the different characters of all the things around
him, and this of itself suggests the belief that all these
characters have a value of their own, unique and indispensable,
each aiming at a distinct aspect of the Divine,
each, if it fulfilled its inner nature, finding, as Plato might
have said, the place where it was best for it to be. Again,
it is clear from Aristotle's whole treatment of the State,
that when he wrote his famous phrase, 'Man is by nature
a political animal', he meant that man, as we should say,
is essentially social. It is part of man's goal to live with
others; it is not merely a means to the goal. His highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
happiness lies in the contemplation of the good, and the
good, Aristotle says, can be contemplated far better in
others than in ourselves. This is a profound saying, and
from this thought springs the deep significance of friendship
in Aristotle's system. The crown of the civic life
he takes to be the community of friends who recognize
the good in each other, and enjoy each other through
this. The wider this community, then, we must surely
say, the better.</p>

<p>For Aristotle then, man's perfection ought to mean the
perfection of every individual, and progress, so far as
he conceives it, involve progress towards this end. This
should lead on to belief in the supreme importance of
the individual soul, and to Kant's great principle that we
should always treat each man as an end in himself.</p>

<p>Thus, if we concentrate on the hopeful elements in
Plato and Aristotle, we may fairly say, I think, that we
can see outlined in their philosophies something like the
following belief: every natural thing in this world, and
every natural creature, so far as it is good,&mdash;and all are
more or less good,&mdash;tends to express some distinct aspect
of a perfect harmony: we human beings are the first
on earth to be definitely conscious of such a tendency,
the first to be able definitely to direct it to its true goal,
and our business in life is therefore threefold: to make
actual our own function in this harmony, to help other
creatures to actualize theirs, and to contemplate every
such manifestation, in men or in things, with reverence
and rejoicing.</p>

<p>The harmony, if complete, would be a manifestation
of a divine reality, and thus the love of God, the love of
our neighbour, the love of nature, self-development,
political life, scientific study, poetic contemplation, and
philosophic speculation, would all unite in one comprehensive
and glorious task.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This, surely, is hopeful enough. But the Greek hope
faltered and sank. Could this harmony ever be realized?
Would not the thwarting element in the world always
drag it down again and again, and drag some men down
always, so that after all progress was impossible, and for
some men should not even be attempted? As a matter
of fact, Plato and Aristotle do limit their exhortations
to a narrow circle of cultured Greeks, and even with them
they doubt of success.</p>

<p>Now this despondency came partly, I think, through
the very sensitiveness of the Hellenic nature. The spectacle
of the ever-baffled struggle in Nature and Man they
felt at times almost intolerable. Aristotle saw that this
perpetual failure in the heart of glorious good made the
very essence of tragedy. The tragic hero is the man of
innate nobleness who yet has some one defect that lays
him open to ruin. Man is set in a world full of difficulties,
a world much of which is dark and strange to him: his
action and those of others have results which he did not,
and in his ignorance could not, foresee; he is not strong
enough for his great task.</p>

<p>All the Greek poets have this deep sadness. Homer
has it, in and through his intense feeling for the beauty
and energy of life. There has never been such war-poetry
as Homer's, and yet there has never been any
which felt more poignantly the senselessness in war.
'And I must come here', Achilles says to his noble enemy
at the close, 'to torture you and your children.'</p>

<p>In the next place, the sadness of the world could not be
lightened for the Greeks by the vision that the modern
theory of evolution has opened up to us of the long advance
in the history of life on the planet. Even their knowledge
of history in the strict sense was scanty, and it is only
a long view of history that is likely to be comforting.
What history they did know could bring them little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
comfort. In the first place it showed them a series of
great civilizations, rising and falling, and those that had
fallen seemed at least as good as those that followed
them. A Greek like Plato knew of the Homeric civilization,
simpler indeed, but fresher and purer than his own.
And he believed, what we now know to be the fact, that
even before the Homeric there had been a wonderful
island-culture, what we call the Minoan, flourishing
before the Homeric. 'There had been kings before
Agamemnon.'</p>

<p>And behind Minos and Agamemnon lay the great, and
by that time the ossifying, kingdom of Egypt, compared
to which the Greeks were, and felt themselves to be, but
children. Plato had seen, finally, the degeneration of
the Persian Empire&mdash;once so magnificent and mighty.</p>

<p>This fact of recurrent decay is one of the heaviest that
the human spirit can shoulder. Any theory of progress
must come to terms with it, for Progress through history is
certainly not an uninterrupted ascent; a spiral is the better
image. And the weight must lie most heavily on a generation
which feels its own self to be in peril of decay. Now
Plato and Aristotle lived at such a period. Greece had
gone through the bitter experiences of the Peloponnesian
War, and the shadow of it lay on them, as on its
historian Thucydides. In that fratricidal conflict Greece
tore herself to pieces. It was a struggle between the
two leaders of the then civilized world, and it has
a terrible likeness to the struggle that is going on now.
From its devastating influence Greece never recovered.
Historians still dispute, and always will, as to the
exact proportion of praise and blame between the two.
But Thucydides himself, a true-hearted Athenian, brings
out the tyrannical side in the Athenian temper. Not indeed
towards her own people, but towards all who were not of
her own immediate stock. Because Athens thought herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the fairest city in the world, as indeed she was, because
she thought herself menaced by Sparta, and menaced
she was, she allowed herself to tyrannize and lightly
took up the burden of war between brethren. There are
few passages in history more stately than the Funeral
Oration of Pericles in which he calls Athens the School
of Hellas, but even in it there is a certain deadly coldness
of heart. And few things are more terrible than the
coarsening of temper which Thucydides depicts as the
war goes on and Pericles is succeeded by his caricature
Cleon, the man who means to prosecute the war vigorously,
and by vigour means ruthlessness. Nor was there ever
a sterner indictment of aggression than that given in the
dialogue between the spokesmen of Melos, the little island
that desired to stand out of the conflict, and the Athenian
representatives who were determined to force her into
their policy. And after that dialogue comes, in Thucydides'
great drama, the fall of Athens.</p>

<p>The city recovered in some measure from her fall, but
only to face another disaster. If she sinned in the
Peloponnesian War through the spirit of aggression, she
sinned in the struggle with Macedon through slackness
and cowardice. In the one struggle she lost comradeship;
in the other she lost liberty. And with the loss of the two
she lost buoyancy. In a deeper sense than Pericles used
the phrase, 'the springtime went out of her year'. Ultimately,
perhaps, we cannot explain why this should be so.
Other nations have had as disheartening experiences and yet
risen above them. Some of the most inspired prophecies
in the Hebrew writings came after the tiny state of Judaea
had been torn in pieces by the insensate conflict between
North and South, and after the whole people had been
swept into captivity. But whatever the ultimate reason,
Athens did not recover. We must not end, however,
on a note of despair. Far from it. The work of Aristotle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and Plato and of the Greeks generally, was cramped for
lack of sympathy and lack of hope, and, strangely enough,
it was after they had passed and their glory with them
that sympathy grew in the world, and after sympathy
grew, hope returned.</p>

<p>For it is exactly in those failing years, when the Hellenic
gave way to the Hellenistic, that men first grasped, and
grasped so firmly that it could hardly be lost again, one of
the fundamental principles on which the whole fabric of
our later civilization has rested, or ought to rest, the great
principle of personal equality, the claim of every individual
to transcendent value, irrespective of race and creed and
endowment. The conquering rule of Alexander, whatever
else it did, broke down the barriers of the little city-states
and made men of different races feel themselves
members of mankind. There rose among the Stoics the
conviction that all men do belong together and are all
made for each other. And with the advent of Christianity
came the belief that every man, however mean and unworthy,
can receive a power that will make him all he
ought to be. The highest is within his reach. There is
no reason now why the glorious life that Hellenism
conceived for a few should not lie open to all men.</p>

<p>Finally, we might say, and truly, that the vast political
organization built up by Rome gave us Europeans, once
and for all, the vision of a united Europe.</p>

<p>That dream has never left it. Even to-day, here and
now, in spite of our disasters, our blunders, and our crimes,
let us not forget it, that dream which is 'not all a dream',
the dream of once again constructing a system in which
we might, all of us, all nations and all men and women,
make progress together in the common task.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN THE MIDDLE AGES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A. J. Carlyle</span></h3>


<p>There still survives, not indeed among students of
history, but among some literary persons, the notion
that the civilization of the Middle Ages was fixed and
unprogressive; that the conditions of these centuries
were wholly different from those of the ancient world and
of modern time; that there was little continuity with the
ancient world, and little connexion with the characteristic
aspects of progress in the modern world.</p>

<p>The truth is very different. It may be doubted whether
at any other time, except perhaps in those two marvellous
centuries of the flower of Greek civilization, there has
been a more rapid development of the most important
elements of civilization than in the period from the end of
the tenth to the end of the thirteenth centuries. While
it is true that much was lost in the ruin of the ancient
world, much also survived, and there was a real continuity
of civilization; indeed some of the greatest conceptions
of the later centuries of the ancient world are exactly
those upon which mediaeval civilization was built. And
again, it was in the Middle Ages that the foundations
were laid upon which the most characteristic institutions
of the modern world have grown.</p>

<p>Indeed this notion that the civilization of the Middle
Ages was fixed and unprogressive is a mere literary
superstition, and its origin is to be found in the ignorance
and perversity of the men of the Renaissance; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hardly less, it must be added, in the foolishness of many
of the conceptions of the Romantic revival.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, excuses for these mistakes and confusions.
The Renaissance represents, among other things,
a great and necessary movement of revolt against a religious
and intellectual civilization which had once been living
and moving, but had tended from the latter years of the
thirteenth century to grow stiff and rigid. It was probably
a real misfortune that the great thinkers and scholars
of the thirteenth century, like Alexander of Hales and
Thomas Aquinas, had embarked upon what was a premature
attempt at the systematization of all knowledge;
they made the same mistake as the Encyclopaedists of
the eighteenth century or Herbert Spencer in the nineteenth,
but with more disastrous results. For this work
unhappily encouraged the mediaeval Church in its most
fatal mistake, its tendency to suspect and oppose the
apprehensions of new aspects of truth.</p>

<p>The men of the Renaissance had to break the forms
under which the schoolmen had thought to express all
truth, they had to carry forward the great enterprise
and adventure of the discovery of truth, and they had
to do this in the teeth of a violent resistance on the part
of those who thought themselves the representatives of
the mediaeval civilization. There are, therefore, excuses
for them in their contempt for the intellectual life of the
past; but there is no real excuse for them in their contempt
for mediaeval art and literature. When they
turned their back upon the immediate past, and endeavoured
pedantically to reproduce the ancient world,
they were guilty of an outrageous ignorance and stupidity,
a stupidity which is expressed in that unhappy phrase of
Pope, the 'Gothic night'. Happily neither the great
artists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries nor the
great poets of England and Spain were much affected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by the classical pedantry of which unhappily Petrarch
was the begetter.</p>

<p>It is this foolishness of the Renaissance which is the
best excuse for the foolishness of the Romantic revival;
the new classical movement had in such a degree
interrupted the continuity of European art that it was
very difficult for men in the eighteenth century to
recover the past, and we must make allowance for the
often ludicrous terms and forms of the new mediaevalism.
Indeed it is a strange and often absurd art&mdash;the half-serious,
half-parodying imitations of Thomson and Walpole
and Wieland, this ludicrous caricature Gothic of Strawberry
Hill and All Souls, the notion of Gothic architecture
as a mass of crockets, battlements, crypts, and dungeons&mdash;and
all in ruins. Indeed, the Romantic conception of the
Middle Ages was often as absurd as that of the Renaissance,
and if we are to get at the truth, if we are to make any
serious attempt to understand the Middle Ages, we must
clear our minds of two superstitions; the one, which we
derive from the Renaissance, that mediaeval civilization
was sterile, ignorant, and content to be ignorant; the
other, which survives from the Romantic movement, that
it was essentially religious, chivalrous and adventurous,
that men spent their time in saying their prayers, making
reverent love to their ladies, or carving the heads of the
infidel.</p>

<p>What I should desire to do is to persuade you that
the more you study the Middle Ages the more you will see
that these men and women were really very much like
ourselves, ignorant, no doubt, of much which is to us
really or superficially important, gifted on the other hand
with some qualities which for the time we seem to have in
a large measure lost, but substantially very like ourselves,
neither very much better nor very much worse. Let me
illustrate this by considering for a moment the figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which to us is typical of the Middle Ages. What was the
mediaeval knight? We think of him as a courteous,
chivalrous person of a romantic and adventurous temper,
whose business it was to fight for his lady or in the service
of religion against the infidel. In reality he was usually
a small landowner, who held his land on condition of
military service to some lord; the title 'knight' means in
its Latin form (<i>miles</i>), simply a soldier, in its Germanic
form a servant, and distinguishes him from the older type
of landowner who held his land in absolute ownership
and free of all service except of a national kind. In
virtue of his holding a certain amount of land he had to
present himself for military service on those occasions
and for those periods for which he could be legally summoned.
But even this description implies a wholly
wrong emphasis, for he was not primarily a soldier, but
a small landowner and cultivator, very much what we
should call a squireen. He was normally much more
concerned about his crops, his cattle and pigs, than about
his lord's affairs and his lord's quarrels. He was ignorant,
often rather brutal, and turbulent, very ready for a quarrel
with his neighbour, but with no taste for national wars,
and the prolonged absence from his home which they
might involve, unless indeed there was a reasonable
prospect of plunder. Indeed, he was a very matter-of-fact
person, with very little sense of romance, and little
taste for adventure unless there was something to be got
out of it. We must dismiss from our minds the pretty
superstitions of romance from Chaucer and Spenser to
the time of the Romantic revival, and we must understand
that the people of the Middle Ages were very much like
ourselves; the times were rougher, more disorderly, there
was much less security, but on the whole the character
of human life was not very different.</p>

<p>What was it, then, that happened with the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ancient world? Well, the civilization of the Roman Empire
was overthrown by our barbarous ancestors, the old
order, and tranquillity, and comfort disappeared, and the
world fell back into discomfort and turbulence, and disorder;
the roads fell into disrepair and were not mended,
the drains were neglected, and the towns dwindled and
shrank. We must remember, however, that this great civilization
was dying out, was failing by some internal weakness,
and that the barbarians only hastened the process.</p>

<p>Much of the achievement of Greece and Rome was
lost, much both material and intellectual, but not all,
and the new civilization which began rapidly to grow
up on the ruins of the old was in many respects
continuous with it. In order, however, that we may
understand this we must remember that the form of
civilization with which the Middle Ages were continuous
was the Graeco-Roman civilization of the later Empire,
and not the great Hellenic civilization itself. What
the Middle Ages knew was primarily that which the
Christian Fathers like St. Augustine and St. Gregory
the Great, St. Basil and St. Gregory of Nazianzus learned
at their schools and universities. Some of these Fathers
were educated at the great universities, like Athens,
others at comparatively humble provincial institutions;
some of them were men of powerful intellect, while others
were more commonplace. What they learned was the
general intellectual system of the late Empire, and what
they learned they handed on to the Middle Ages; but
it was not the great intellectual culture of Greece. We
have still too strong an inclination to think of the ancient
world as one and homogeneous; we have not yet sufficiently
apprehended the great changes both in the form
and in the temper of that world. And yet the varieties, the
changes, are very diverse, the outlook, the artistic methods
of the Homeric poetry are very different from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
emotional and intellectual modernity of Euripides. The
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle is very different from
that of the Stoics and Neoplatonists. In that picturesque
but perhaps not very felicitous phrase which Mr. Murray
has borrowed from Mr. Cornford, there was a 'failure of
nerve' which separates the earlier from the later stages
of the moral and intellectual culture of the ancient world.
However this may be, and we shall have more to say
about this presently, the civilization of the Middle Ages
was made up on the one hand of elements drawn from
the later Empire, and on the other of characteristics and
principles which seem to have belonged to the Barbarian
races themselves.</p>

<p>With the end of the sixth century the ancient world
had passed away and the mediaeval world had begun,
and we have to consider the nature and movement of
the new order, or rather we have to consider some of its
elements, and their development, especially during the
period from the end of the tenth century to the end of
the thirteenth, during which it reached its highest level.
We have to pass over the great attempt of the ninth
century, for we can only deal with a small part of a large
subject, and we shall only deal with a few aspects of it,
and chiefly with the development of the spiritual conception
of life which we call religion, with the reconstruction
of the political order of society, with the beginning
of a new intellectual life and the pursuit of truth, and with
the development under new forms of the passion for beauty.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have been compelled to warn you against the romantic
superstition that the Middle Ages were specifically
religious, and yet it is quite true that the first aspect of
mediaeval life which compels our attention is exactly
the development of the sense of the significance of the
spiritual quality of life. This was the first great task of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the men of the Middle Ages, and this was in a real sense
their achievement; but not as contradicting the characteristic
developments of the Hellenic civilization, but rather
as completing and fulfilling it. It is indeed a singular
superstition that the Hellenic world was lacking in
spiritual insight, but I need only refer you to Miss Stawell's
lecture, as serving to show you how great and how real
this was. It really was not a mistake when an honest but
rather stupid man like Justin Martyr, and the more
acute and penetrating minds of the Alexandrian Fathers
like Clement and Origen, thought that they heard the
authentic accents of the 'Word' of God in the great
philosophers of Greece, and especially in Plato.</p>

<p>The apprehension of the spiritual element in human
experience was not wanting in Hellenic civilization, but
it needed a further development and especially in relation
to those new apprehensions of personality and individuality,
whose appearance we can trace both in the post-Aristotelian
philosophy, and in the later Hebrew prophets and poets,
which Christianity found in the world, and to which
in its conception of the human in the Divine, and the
Divine in the human, it gave a new force and breath. It
is easy for us to smile at what may well be the over-rhetorical
phrases of Seneca when he speaks of the
self-sufficingness (<span class='correction' title='autarkeia'>&#945;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) of the wise man, or when he
says that the wise man is, but for his mortality, like
God himself; and yet these rhetorical phrases are, after
all, the forms of an apprehension which has changed and
is changing the world. And, it must be remembered that
to understand the full significance of these phrases, we
must bear in mind that the men of the Graeco-Roman
civilization had put aside once and for all the 'natural'
distinction between the 'Greek' and the 'Barbarian',
had recognized that men were equal and alike, not
different and unequal, that all men were possessed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
reason, and all were capable of virtue,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or, in the Christian
terms, all men are the children of God and capable of
communion with Him.</p>

<p>It is this new apprehension of life for which the Middle
Ages found a new form in the great organization of the
Church, and it is this which justifies our sense of the
great and permanent significance of the tremendous
conflict of the Papacy and the Empire. It is true that at
times some of the representatives of the Church seem to
have fallen into the mistake of aiming at a tyranny of the
Church over the State, which would have been in the end
as disastrous to the Church itself as to the State. But the
normal principle of the Church was that which was first
fully stated by Pope Gelasius I in the fifth century,
that the two great authorities, the spiritual and the
temporal, are each divine, each draws its authority
ultimately from God himself, each is supreme and
independent in its own sphere, while each recognizes
the authority of the other within its proper sphere.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, the freedom of the spiritual life which the
mediaeval Church was endeavouring to defend; it was
the apprehension that there was some ultimate quality in
human nature which stands and must stand outside of the
direct or coercive control of society, which lies behind all
the confused clamour of the conflicts of Church and State.</p>

<p>It is true that in this great and generous effort to secure
the freedom of the human soul men in some measure
lost their way. They demanded and in a measure they
succeeded in asserting the freedom of the religious
organization, as against the temporal organization, but
in doing this they went perilously near to denying the
freedom of the individual spiritual experience. They
went perilously near to denying it, but they never wholly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
forgot it. The Church claimed and exercised an immense
authority in religion, so immense an authority that it
might easily seem as though there were no place left for
the freedom of the individual judgement and conscience.
And yet that was not the case. The theory of excommunication
that is set out in the canonical literature of the
Middle Ages has generally been carelessly studied and
imperfectly understood. It was the greatest and most
masterful of the Popes, Innocent III, who laid down in
memorable phrases which are embodied in the great collection
of the Decretals, that if a Christian man or woman
is convinced in his own mind and conscience that it
would be a mortal sin to do or to leave undone some
action, he must follow his own conscience even against
the command of the authorities of the Church, and
must submit patiently to Church censures and even
excommunication; for it may well happen that the
Church may condemn him whom God approves, or
approve him whom God condemns.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This is no isolated
or exceptional opinion, but is the doctrine which is
constantly laid down in the canonical literature.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It is,
I think, profoundly true to say that when men at last
revolted against what seemed to them the exaggerated
claims of the Church, when they slowly fought their way
towards toleration and religious freedom, they were only
asserting and carrying out its one most vital principle,
the principle of the independence or autonomy of the
spiritual life; the modern world is only fulfilling the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>I do not continue to develop this aspect of the progress
of western civilization, not because it is unimportant,
for indeed it is perhaps the greatest and most significant
aspect of mediaeval life, but because it is well known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to you, and indeed, it has generally been insisted on to
such a degree as to obscure the other aspects of progress
in the Middle Ages, with which we must deal.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And first I would ask you to observe that it was in
these centuries that there were laid over again the foundations
of the social and political order of civilization, and
that there were devised those forms of the political order
upon which the structure of modern society is founded.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the conception of the divine
nature of political authority, the normal and fundamental
mediaeval view of the State. If we translate this into
more general terms we shall find that its meaning is that
the State has an ethical or moral purpose or function; the
State exists to secure and to maintain justice. You
must not, indeed, confuse this great conception with that
foolish perversion of it which was suggested, I think, by
some characteristically reckless phrases of St. Augustine,
stated in set terms by St. Gregory the Great, almost
forgotten in the Middle Ages, and unhappily revived by
the perversity of some Anglicans and Gallicans in the
seventeenth century. This foolish perversion, which we
know as the theory of the 'Divine Right of Kings', is
indeed the opposite of the great Pauline and mediaeval
conception of the divine nature of political authority, for
to St. Paul, to the more normal Fathers like St. Ambrose,
and to the political theory of the Middle Ages authority
is divine just because, and only in so far as, its aim and
purpose is the attainment and maintenance of justice.
Indeed, it is not only the notion of the 'Divine Right'
which was inconsistent with the mediaeval conception
of the State, but the notion of an absolute sovereignty
inherent in the State, that notion with which some
eccentric or ignorant modern political theorists, ignorant
of Rousseau as well as of Aristotle, have played, to the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
danger of society; we have, indeed, got beyond the theory
of the sovereignty of the king, but we are in some danger
of being hag-ridden by the imposture of the sovereignty of
the majority. Whatever mistakes the people of the Middle
Ages may have made, they were, with rare exceptions,
clear that there was no legitimate authority which was
not just, and which did not make for justice.</p>

<p>It is here that we find the real meaning of the second
great political principle of the Middle Ages, that is the
supremacy of law; that it is the law which is the supreme
authority in the State, the law which is over every
person in the State. When John of Salisbury, the secretary
of Thomas &agrave; Becket, wishes to distinguish between the
prince and the tyrant, he insists that the prince is one
who rules according to law, while the tyrant is one who
ignores and violates the law.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> And in a memorable
phrase, Bracton, the great English jurist of the latter
part of the thirteenth century, lays it down dogmatically
that the king has two superiors, God and the law.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> There
is an absurd notion still current among more ignorant
persons&mdash;I have even heard some theologians fall into
the mistake&mdash;that men in the Middle Ages thought
of authority as something arbitrary and unintelligible,
while the truth is that such a conception was wholly
foreign to the temper of that time. It is quite true that
the political life of the Middle Ages seems constantly to
oscillate between anarchy and despotism, but this is not
because the men of those days did not understand the
meaning of law and of freedom, but because they were only
slowly working out the organization through which these
can be secured. The supreme authority in the mediaeval
state was the law, and it was supreme because it was
taken by them to be the embodiment of justice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p><p>It is again out of this principle that there arose another
great conception which is still often thought to be modern,
but which is really mediaeval, the conception that the
authority of the ruler rests upon and is conditioned by an
agreement or contract between him and the people. For
this agreement was not an abstract conception, but was
based upon the mutual oaths of the mediaeval coronation
ceremony, the oath of the king to maintain the law, and
to administer justice, and the oath of the people to serve
and obey the king whom they had recognized or elected.
The people do, indeed, owe the king honour and loyal
service, but only on the condition that he holds inviolable
his oath. The ruler who breaks this is a tyrant, and for
him there was no place in mediaeval political theory.
This conception was expressed in very plain and even
crude terms by Manegold in the eleventh century when he
said that the king was in the same relation to the community
as the man who is hired to keep the pigs to his
master. If the swineherd fails to do his work the master
turns him off and finds another. And if the king or prince
refuses to fulfil the conditions on which he holds his
power he must be deposed.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> John of Salisbury in the
twelfth century expressed this in even stronger terms when
he said that if the prince became a tyrant and violated the
laws, he had no rights, and should be removed, and if
there were no other way to do it, it was lawful for any
citizen to slay him.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>These are, no doubt, extreme forms of the mediaeval
conception, but the principle that the authority of the
ruler was conditioned by his faithful discharge of his
obligations is the normal doctrine of the Middle Ages, is
maintained by the compilers of the feudal law-books of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the Kingdom of Jerusalem, by the great English jurist
Bracton, by St. Thomas Aquinas, and even by some of
the most representative of the Roman jurists of Bologna,
like Azo.</p>

<p>These were the fundamental principles of the conception
of the nature of political authority whose development
we can trace in the Middle Ages, and it is out of these
conceptions that there grew the system of the control
of the common affairs of the community by means of
the representation of the community. For it should be
more clearly understood than it is, that the representative
system was the creation of the mediaeval political genius, it
was these men&mdash;to whom even yet the more ignorant would
deny the true political instinct&mdash;it was these men who
devised that method upon which the structure of modern
civilized government has been built up.</p>

<p>There is, however, yet another aspect of the development
of political civilization which deserves our attention
if we are to understand the nature of political progress
in the Middle Ages. It was in these centuries that there
were created the elementary forms of the administrative
system of government. And indeed, there is perhaps
no clearer distinction between a barbarian and a civilized
government than this, that while the barbarian government
hangs precariously on the life of the capable king,
the civilized government is carried on continuously by an
organized civil service. It would be impossible here to
discuss the earlier forms of this in the organization of
government by Charles the Great, or the very interesting
developments of the royal or imperial chapel as the nucleus
of a civil service in Germany, it is enough here to remind
ourselves that it is the creation of this organized administration
by Henry I and Henry II of England which laid
the foundations of our national order. Enough has,
I think, been said to illustrate the reality and significance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the progressive reconstruction of the political order of
Western society in the Middle Ages.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It may, however, be said that this may all be true, but
that in all this we have after all only an example of the
preoccupation of the Middle Ages with conduct and religion.
I must, therefore, ask you to consider the character and
development of the intellectual movement of the Middle
Ages. And here, fortunately, we can find the best of
guidance in Dr. Rashdall's great work on <i>The Universities
of Europe in the Middle Ages</i>, and in Dr. R. L. Poole's
<i>Illustrations of Mediaeval Thought</i>. Indeed I could wish that
a little more attention was given to the history and character
of the intellectual movement which the Universities
represent, and perhaps a little less to reading and discussing
the great scholastic works of the thirteenth century,
which are almost impossible to understand except in relation
to the intellectual movements of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The new intellectual movement came very suddenly
in the last years of the eleventh century; why it should
have come then is hard to determine, but it seems reasonable
to say that it represents the reawakening of the
desire for knowledge which had been in abeyance during
the stormy centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire
in the West, when men had little leisure for anything but
the constant labour to secure a little decent order and
peace. For a few years, indeed, in the ninth century
the genius of Charlemagne had almost restored the order
of civilization, and even in those few years the human
mind reasserted itself, and for a moment the learning and
culture which had been preserved mainly by the Irish
and their pupils in Britain, and in Central Europe, flowered
and bore fruit; but with his death Western Europe
plunged again into anarchy and misery, and it was only
slowly that the genius of the great German emperors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in Central Europe, and of the Norman settlers in France
and England, rebuilt the commonwealth of European
civilization. By the end of the eleventh century the
work was not indeed done, but was being done, and men
had again a little leisure, and the desire for knowledge
reawakened, but indeed it was no mere gentle desire, but
a veritable passion which possessed the men of the twelfth
century, and it was this spontaneous passion which
produced the universities.</p>

<p>The first thing, indeed, which we must observe about
the oldest universities of Europe, especially Bologna, Paris,
and Oxford, is just this, that they were not made by any
external authority, that they did not derive their being
from Church or State, from pope or king, but that they
were formed by the enthusiasm and passion which drew
men from every quarter of Europe to sit at the feet of
some man or another who could give them the knowledge
which they desired, and, in their turn, to become teachers.
It is quite true that as time went on, and they found
that popes and kings were friendly and interested, these
groups of students procured for themselves bulls and
charters of recognition and protection, but while later
universities may trace their foundation to these respectable
patrons, the older universities recognize them indeed as
benefactors and friends, but not as founders, but rather
claim that they grew out of men's desire for knowledge,
and that they were recognized by the general consent of
the civilized world.</p>

<p>In the second place it is important, and especially I think
in these days, to understand that the men who thus
created the universities in their eagerness to learn, were
of every class and condition, rich and poor, noble and
simple, and they lived as they could, in comfortable
quarters if they were wealthy men, or in the garrets and
cellars of the citizens if they were poor, and for the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
part they were poor; but neither poverty nor riches
could destroy their noble thirst for knowledge. The life of
the universities was indeed turbulent and disorderly, the
students were always at war with the citizens, and, when
they were not breaking the heads of the citizens or having
their heads broken by them, they were at war with each
other, the men of the north with the southerners, the
western with the eastern; for the universities were not
local or national institutions, but were made up of a cosmopolitan
crowd of men of every nation in Europe, intelligible
to each other, as unhappily we are not, by the
universal knowledge and use of that mediaeval Latin,
which might distress the Ciceronian ears of a pedant of
the Renaissance, but was a good, useful, and adaptable
language. It was a turbulent, disorderly, brutal, profligate,
and drunken world, for the students were as hard
drinkers as the citizens, but it was animated, it was made
alive by a true passion for knowledge, by an unwearied
and never satisfied intellectual curiosity.</p>

<p>But it will be asked, what did they learn? Well, the
only answer that one can give is that they learned whatever
there was to learn. Our literary friends have often
still the impression that in the Middle Ages men spent
their whole time in learning theology, and were afraid of
other forms of knowledge, but this is a singular delusion.
As the universities developed a system, their studies were
arranged in the main under four heads, the general studies
of what came to be called the Faculty of Arts, and the
professional studies of the three superior Faculties of Law,
Medicine, and Theology, but the student was not normally
allowed to study in the three superior Faculties until he
had spent some years in the studies of the Faculty of Arts.
It is therefore with this latter that we are primarily
occupied. The studies in the Faculty of Arts consisted,
to use our modern terminology, of literature, philosophy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and science, and the accomplished mediaeval student was
expected to know whatever there was to know.</p>

<p>And this means&mdash;what is strangely often forgotten&mdash;that
the studies of the mediaeval universities were
primarily based upon the literature which had survived
from the ancient world. The Latin poets and orators
were their models of literary art, the surviving treatises
of the ancients their text-books in medicine, and the Greek
philosophers in Latin translations, or in Latin works
founded on them, their masters in thought. To understand
the extent of the influence and the knowledge of
antiquity of a twelfth-century scholar we need only turn
again to John of Salisbury, and we shall find him as
familiar as any Renaissance scholar with Latin literature,
and possessing a very considerable acquaintance with
Greek literature so far as it could be obtained through the
Latin.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Indeed, so much is he possessed by the literature
of antiquity that in works like the <i>Policraticus</i> he can
hardly write two lines together without a quotation from
some classical author. This type of literary scholarship
has been too much overlooked, and, as I said before, too
exclusive an attention has been given to the thirteenth-century
schoolmen, who are neither from a literary nor
from a philosophical point of view as representative of
mediaeval scholars, and philosophically they are often
really unmediaeval, for the general quality of mediaeval
thought is its Platonism: the Aristotelian logic was indeed
known to the Middle Ages through B&#339;thius, but the
other Aristotelian works were not known till towards the
middle of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be impossible here, even if I were competent,
which I am not, to discuss the character of mediaeval
thought, but one thing we can observe, one aspect of the
intellectual method which may serve to clear away some
confusion. The great intellectual master of the Middle
Ages was Abelard, and the method which he elaborated
in his <i>Sic et Non</i> is the method which imposed itself upon
all aspects of mediaeval thought.</p>

<p>It has often been supposed that mediaeval thinkers
were in such a sense the creatures of authority that it was
impossible for them to exercise any independent judgement;
how far this may have been true of the decadent
scholasticism of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
I do not pretend to say, but such a judgement is a ludicrous
caricature of the living and active thought of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, and a little consideration of the
critical method which Abelard developed is sufficient to
correct this. This is as follows: first some general
principle is enunciated for consideration, then all the
authorities which may seem to support it are cited, then
all the authorities against, and finally the writer delivers
his own judgement, criticizing and explaining the opinions
which may seem contrary to it. The method has its
defects and its limitations, but its characteristic is rather
that of scepticism than of credulity. And it is on this
method that the most important systems of knowledge of
the Middle Ages are constructed. It was applied by
Gratian in his <i>Decretum</i>, the first great reasoned treatise
on Church law, and leads there often to somewhat unexpected
conclusions, such as that even the legislative
authority of the Pope is limited by the consenting custom
of the Christian people;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and it is this method upon
which the great systematic treatises, like the <i>Suma</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>Theologica</i> of St. Thomas Aquinas, were constructed in
the thirteenth century. Whatever its defects may be the
method cannot fairly be accused of ignoring difficulties
and of a submission to authority which leaves no place
for the critical reason.</p>

<p>I have, I hope, said enough to make it clear that there
was a real and living intellectual movement in the Middle
Ages, and that even in those days men had resumed the
great adventure of the pursuit of truth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We can only for a moment consider the significance
and the character of mediaeval civilization as it expresses
itself in Art, and we must begin by noticing a distinction
between mediaeval art and mediaeval learning, which is
of the first importance.</p>

<p>The intellectual movement of the Middle Ages was
related to the ancient world, both in virtue of that
continuity which was mediated by the Christian Fathers,
whose education was that of the later Empire, and also in
virtue of the intense and eager care with which mediaeval
scholars studied all that they possessed of ancient literature.
The relation of the art of the Middle Ages to the
ancient world was quite different. There was no continuity
between the vernacular poetry of the Middle Ages
and that of the ancient world, and while there was
a certain continuity in architecture and in mosaic painting,
this amounted to little more than that the mediaeval
artists took the formal structure or method as the starting-point
of their own independent and original work. For
the western art of the third and fourth centuries was
conventional and decadent, and had apparently lost its
power of recovery, while the art of the centuries which
followed was at first rude and imperfect, but was full of
new life, determined in its reality and dominated by some
intimate sense of beauty; it was in no sense imitative of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ancient art, but grew and changed under the terms of its
own inherent life and power.</p>

<p>Mediaeval art, whatever else is to be said about it, was
new and independent, and it had all the variety, the
audacious experiments, characteristic of a living art.
Nothing is so foolish as to imagine that it was uniform
and unchanging. Indeed, from the historical point of
view, the interest of the study of it is curiously contrasted
with that of the art of the ancient world. There we have
only an imperfect and fragmentary knowledge of the
earlier and ruder form; its history, as we know it, might
almost be said to begin with the perfection of the sixth
and fifth centuries, and what we know after that is the
history of a long decadence, not indeed without new
developments of importance, as for instance in the
architectural structure of Roman building, and perhaps
in the sculpture of the Early Empire on one side, and
in certain aspects of Latin literature on another. The
history of mediaeval art is the history of the long development
from what are generally rude forms to the highly
developed art of the thirteenth century, a development
full of incidents and experiments and variety. I have
called the early form rude, but the phrase is not very
happy, as those who know either the early mosaic or the
early epic will understand.</p>

<p>There are still some people, I suppose, who think that
mediaeval poetry was all of one kind, cast in one mould,
but the truth is that it is of every form and character.
It ranges from the bold imaginative realism of the Epic
of England, Iceland, Germany, and France, to the exquisite
and gracious but somewhat artificial allegory of the
<i>Romance of the Rose</i>. It includes the first great emotional
poetry of the modern world&mdash;the sense of the greatness
and tragedy of human passion has perhaps never been
expressed in more moving terms than in the <i>Tristan and</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<i>Iseult</i> of Thomas or Beroul&mdash;but it also includes the
mordant satire of the Renard poetry and of Jean de
Meun, and the gross realistic humour of the Fabliaux.
The mediaeval drama, in whose complex development
we have to trace many strands, probably represents in
its oldest forms the coarse farcical buffoonery which may
be related to the last fashions of the ancient world; it
received a new impulse from the dramatization of scripture
history in the twelfth century; but in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, at least in France, it had already
become substantially a drama of romantic or contemporary
life, as we can see in Jean Bodel's <i>Jeu de St. Nicholas</i>,
in Adam de la Halle's <i>Jeu de la Feuill&eacute;e</i> and <i>Robin et Marion</i>,
and in dramas like the <i>Empress of Rome</i> or the <i>Otho</i>.
Whatever criticism we might want to make on mediaeval
literature, at least we cannot say that it was of one type
and of one mood.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out the movement and
changes in the other forms of art in the Middle Ages; it
is only necessary to remind ourselves that, while we can
see that the artists were often hampered by inadequate
technical knowledge, they were not conventional or
merely imitative.</p>

<p>It would be impossible here to consider the history of
mosaic painting, and its development from the decadent
Graeco-Roman work of Santa Pudenziana in Rome, to
the magnificent and living decorations of St. Mark's in
Venice, or of the cathedral of Monreale. It is enough to
remind ourselves of the immense interval which lies
between the rude but living sculpture of the ninth century,
and the exquisite grace of Chester or Wells, and of that
development of architecture which culminates in the
majesty of Durham, and in the beauty of Chartres and
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if we have yet at all fully or correctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
appreciated the nature of mediaeval art; there has been
a good deal of foolish talk about 'primitives', which
usually goes with a singular ignorance of mediaeval
civilization; the one thing which is already clear, and
which grows clearer, is that the men of those ages had an
instinct and a passion for beauty which expressed itself
in almost every thing that they touched; and, whatever
we have gained, we have in a large measure lost this.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The mediaeval world was then a living growing world,
neither cut off from the past, nor unrelated to the future.
It was a rough and turbulent world, our ancestors were
dogged, quarrelsome, and self-assertive, and the first
task of civilization was to produce some sort of decent
order. The world was a long way off from the firm
urbanity of the English policeman. And yet the men of
the Middle Ages never fell into that delusion which, as it
would seem, has ruined other civilizations; the great effort
for order was not in their mind to be fulfilled by any mere
mechanical discipline, by any system imposed from
outside, the only system of order which they were prepared
to accept was one which should express the character,
the tradition, and finally the will of the whole community.
The great phrase of Edward I's summons to
Parliament, 'Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus approbetur'
(That which concerns all, must be approved by all), was
not a mere tag, as some foolish people have thought, but
expressed the character and the genius of a living political
civilization.</p>

<p>And this rough turbulent world was inspired by a great
breath of spiritual and intellectual and artistic life and
freedom.</p>

<p>It might well seem as though the Church and religion
were merely a new bondage, and in part that is true, but
it is not the whole truth. With all its mistakes the religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of the Middle Ages meant the growing apprehension of the
reality of that 'love which moves the sun and other stars',
it meant the growth of reverence for that which is beyond
and above humanity and which is also within it. For it
is the last truth of the Christian faith that we know God
only under the terms of human life and nature. And with
all the cruelty and brutality of the Middle Ages they
taught men love as well as obedience.</p>

<p>Again, it was in these ages, as soon as the confusion
of the outer world was a little reduced, that the passion
for knowledge awoke again in men's hearts. It is true
that some were afraid lest the eager inquiry of men's
minds should destroy the foundations of that order which
men were slowly achieving, but still the passionate
pursuit of knowledge has rarely been more determined.
And once again the world was rough, but these men had
an instinct, a passion for beauty which expressed itself
in almost everything which they touched. They had
not, indeed, the almost miraculous sense and mastery of
the great artists of Greece, that did not come again till
the time of the great Italian artists of the fifteenth
century. But they were free from pedantry, from
formalism, they left the dying art of the ancient world
and made their own way. Their sense of colour was
almost infallible, as those who have seen the mosaics of
the older Roman basilicas and of St. Mark's in Venice
will know; but, indeed, we have only to look at the
illuminated manuscripts which are to be found in all our
libraries. And in that great art in which, above all
perhaps, they expressed themselves, in their great architecture,
we see the growth of a constructive genius which
is only overshadowed by the superb beauty of its form.</p>

<p>A rough, disorderly, turbulent, greedy, cruel world, but
it knew the human soul, and it knew the human heart.
The ancient world had ended in a great destruction, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the sadness and emptiness of its last days compel us to
feel that it was well that it should end. And the new
world was a world of life, of crude force and restless
energy, and from it we have received the principles and
the forms of a great civilization, and the temper which
is never satisfied, for there is no end to life.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN RELIGION</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baron Friedrich von H&uuml;gel</span></h3>


<p>The difficulties are deep and delicate which confront
any man at all well acquainted with the fuller significance
of Religion and of Progress, who attempts clearly and
shortly to describe or define the ultimate relations between
these two sets of fact and conviction. It is plain that
Religion is the deeper and richer of the two terms; and
that we have here, above all, to attempt to fathom the
chief elements and forces of Religion as such, and then to
see whether Progress is really traceable in Religion at all.
And again it is clear that strongly religious souls will, as
such, hold that Religion answers to, and is occasioned
by, the action, within our human life and needs, of great,
abiding, living non-human Realities; and yet, if such
souls are at all experienced and sincere, they will also
admit&mdash;as possibly the most baffling of facts&mdash;that the
human individuals, families, races, are relatively rare in
whom this sense and need of Religion is strongly, sensitively
active. Thus the religion of most men will
either all but completely wither or vanish before the
invasion of other great facts and interests of human life&mdash;Economics
or Politics or Ethics, or again, Science, Art,
Philosophy; or it will, more frequently, become largely
assimilated, in its conception, valuation, and practice, to
the quite distinct, and often subtly different, conceptions,
valuations, and practices pertaining to such of these other
ranges and levels of human life as happen here to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
vigorously active. And such assimilations are, of course,
effected with a particular Philosophy or Ethic, mostly
some passing fashion of the day, which does not reach the
deepest laws and standards even of its own domain, and
which, if taken as Religion, will gravely numb and mar
the power and character of such religious perception as
may still remain in this particular soul.</p>

<p>I will, then, first attempt some discriminations in
certain fundamental questions concerning the functioning
of our minds, feelings, wills. I will next attempt short,
vivid descriptions of the chief stages in the Jewish and
Christian Religions, with a view to tracing here what may
concern their progress; and will very shortly illustrate the
main results attained by the corresponding main peculiarities
of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Mohammedanism.
And I will finally strive to elucidate and to
estimate, as clearly as possible, the main facts in past and
present Religion which concern the question of religious
'Progressiveness'.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>I begin with insisting upon some seven discriminations
which, even only forty years ago, would have appeared
largely preposterous to the then fashionable philosophy.</p>

<p>First, then, our Knowledge is always wider and deeper
than is our Science. I know my mother, I know my dog,
I know my favourite rose-tree; and this, although I am
quite ignorant of the anatomical differences between
woman and man; of the psychological limits between
dog and human being; or of the natural or artificial
botanical order to which my rose-plant belongs. Any
kind or degree of consciousness on my part as to these
three realities is a knowledge of their content. 'Knowledge
is not simply the reduction of phenomena to law
and their resolution into abstract elements; since thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the unknowable would be found well within the facts of
experience itself, in so far as these possess a concrete
character which refuses translation into abstract relations.'
So Professor Aliotta urges with unanswerable truth.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>And next, this spontaneous awareness of other realities
by myself, the reality Man, contains always, from the
first, both matter and form, and sense, reason, feeling,
volition, all more or less in action. Sir Henry Jones
insists finely: 'The difference between the primary and
elementary data of thought on the one hand, and the
highest forms of systematized knowledge on the other, is
no difference in kind, analogous to a mere particular and
a mere universal; but it is a difference of articulation.'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, direct, unchallengeable Experience is always
only experience of a particular moment; only by means
of Thought, and trust in Thought, can such Experience
be extended, communicated, utilized. The sceptic, to be
at all effective, practises this trust as really as does his
opponent. Thought, taken apart from Experience, is
indeed artificial and arid; but Experience without
Thought, is largely an orderless flux. Philosophers as
different as the Neo-Positivist Mach and the Intuitionist
Bergson, do indeed attempt to construct systems composed
solely of direct Experience and pure Intuition; and,
at the same time, almost ceaselessly insist upon the sheer
novelty, the utter unexpectedness of all direct Experience,
and the entire artificiality of the constructions of Thought&mdash;constructions
which alone adulterate our perceptions
of reality with the non-realities repetition, uniformity,
foreseeableness. Yet the amazing success of the application
of such constructions to actual Nature stares us all
in the face. 'It is, indeed, strange,' if that contention
be right, 'that facts behave as if they too had a turn for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
mathematics.' Assuredly 'if thought, with its durable
and coherent structure, were not the reflection of some
order of stable relations in the nature of things, it would
be worthless as an organ of life'.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, both Space and Time are indeed essential
constituents of all our perceptions, thoughts, actions, at
least in this life. Yet Time is perhaps the more real, and
assuredly the richer, constituent of the two. But this
rich reality applies only to Concrete or Filled Time,
Duration, in which our experiences, although always
more or less successive, interpenetrate each other in
various degrees and ways, and are thus more or less
simultaneous. An absolutely even flow of equal, mutually
exclusive moments, on the contrary, exists only for our
theoretical thinking, in Abstract, Empty, or Clock time.
Already, in 1886, Professor James Ward wrote: 'In
time, conceived as physical, there is no trace of intensity;
in time, as psychically experienced, duration is primarily
an intensive magnitude.'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And in 1889 Professor Bergson,
in his <i>Essai sur les Donn&eacute;es Imm&eacute;diates de la Conscience</i>,
gave us exquisite descriptions of time as we really
experience it, of 'duration strictly speaking', which
'does not possess moments that are identical or exterior
to each other'.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Thus all our real soul life, in proportion
to its depth, moves in Partial Simultaneity; and it
apprehends, requires and rests, at its deepest, in an
overflowingly rich Pure Simultaneity.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Man is Body as well as Soul, and the two are
closely interrelated. The sensible perception of objects,
however humble, is always necessary for the beginning,
and (in the long run) for the persistence and growth, of the
more spiritual apprehensions of man. Hence Historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Persons and Happenings, Institutions, affording Sensible
Acts and Contacts, and Social Corporations, each
different according to the different ranges and levels of
life, can hardly fail to be of importance for man's full
awakening&mdash;even ethical and spiritual. Professor Ernst
Troeltsch, so free from natural prejudice in favour of such
a Sense-and-Spirit position, has become perhaps the most
adequate exponent of this great fact of life, which is ever
in such danger of evaporation amidst the intellectual and
leading minority of men.</p>

<p>Sixthly, the cultivated modern man is still largely
arrested and stunted by the spell of Descartes, with his
insistence upon immediate unity of outlook and perfect
clearness of idea as the sole, universal tests, indeed constituents,
of truth. 'I judged that I could take for my
general rule that the things which we conceive very
clearly and very distinctly are all true'&mdash;these and these
alone.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Thus thenceforth Mathematics and Mechanics
have generally been held to be the only full and typical
sciences, and human knowledge to be co-extensive with
such sciences alone. Yet Biology and Psychology now
rightly claim to be sciences, each with its own special
methods and tests distinct from those of Mathematics
and Mechanics. Indeed, the wisest and most fruitful
philosophy is now coming to see that 'Reality generally
eludes our thought, when thought is reduced to mathematical
formulas'.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Concrete thought, contrariwise, finds
full room also for History, Philosophy, Religion, for each
as furnishing rich subject-matters for Knowledge or
Science, of a special but true kind.</p>

<p>Seventhly. Already Mathematics and Mechanics absolutely
depend, for the success of their applications to
actual Nature, upon a spontaneous correspondence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
between the human reason and the Rationality of Nature.
The immensity of this success is an unanswerable proof
that this rationality is not imposed, but found there, by
man. But Thought without a Thinker is an absurd
proposition. Thus faith in Science is faith in God.
Perhaps the most impressive declaration of this necessary
connexion between Knowledge and Theism stands at the
end of that great work, Christoph Sigwart's <i>Logik</i>. 'As
soon as we raise the question as to the real <i>right</i>', the
adequate reason, 'of our demands for a correspondence,
within our several sciences, between the principles and
the objects of the researches special to each, there emerges
the need for the Last and Unconditional Reason. And
the actual situation is not that this Reason appears only
on the horizon of our finite knowledge,' as Kant would
have it. 'Not in thus merely extending our knowledge lies
the significance of the situation, but in the fact that this
Unconditional Reason constitutes the presupposition
without which no desire for Knowledge (in the proper and
strict sense of the word) is truly thinkable.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>And lastly, all this and more points to philosophical
Agnosticism as an artificial system, and one hopelessly
inadequate to the depths of human experience. Assuredly
Bossuet is right: 'man knows not the whole of anything';
and mystery, in this sense, is also of the essence of all
higher religion. But what man knows of anything is
that thing manifested, not essentially travestied, in that
same thing's appearances. We men are most assuredly
realities forming part of a real world-whole of various
realities; those other realities continuously affect our
own reality; we cannot help thinking certain things about
these other realities; and these things, when accepted
and pressed home by us in action or in science, turn out,
by our success in this their utilization, to be rightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
apprehended by us, as parts of interconnected, objective
Nature. Thus our knowledge of Reality is real as far as
it goes, and philosophical Agnosticism is a <i>doctrinaire</i>
position. We can say with Herbert Spencer, in spite of
his predominant Agnosticism, that 'the error' committed
by philosophers intent upon demonstrating the limits and
conditions of consciousness 'consists in assuming that
consciousness contains <i>nothing but</i> limits and conditions,
to the entire neglect of that which is limited and conditioned'.
In reality 'there is some thing which alike
forms the raw material of definite thought and remains
after the definiteness, which thinking gave to it, has been
destroyed'.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Let us next consider five of the most ancient and
extensively developed amongst the still living Religions:
the Israelitish-Jewish and the Christian religions shall, as
by far the best known to us and as the most fully articulated,
form the great bulk of this short account; the
Confucian, Buddhist, and Mohammedan religions will
be taken quite briefly, only as contrasts to, or elucidations
of, the characteristics found in the Jewish and Christian
faiths. All this in view of the question concerning the
relations between Religion and Progress.</p>

<p>1. We can roughly divide the Israelitish-Jewish religion
into three long periods; in each the points that specially
concern us will greatly vary in clearness, importance, and
richness of content.</p>

<p>The first period, from the time of the founder Moses
and the Jewish exodus out of Egypt to the appearance
of the first great prophet Elijah (say 1300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to about
860 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) is indeed but little known to us; yet it gives
us the great historical figure of the initial lawgiver, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
recipient and transmitter of deep ethical and religious
experiences and convictions. True, the code of King
Hammurabi of Babylon (in 1958 to 1916 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; or, according
to others, in about 1650) anticipates many of the laws
of the <i>Book of the Covenant</i> (Exod. xx, 22-xxiii. 33), the
oldest amongst the at all lengthy bodies of laws in the
Pentateuch; and, again, this covenant appears to presuppose
the Jewish settlement in Canaan (say in 1250 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>)
as an accomplished fact. And, indeed, the Law and
the books of Moses generally have undoubtedly passed
through a long, deep, wide, and elaborate development,
of which three chief stages, all considerably subsequent
to the Covenant-Book, have, by now, been established
with substantial certainty and precision. The record of
directly Mosaic sayings and writings is thus certainly
very small. Yet it is assuredly a gross excess to deny the
historical reality of Moses, as even distinguished scholars
such as Edward Meyer and Bernhard Stade have done.
Far wiser here is Wellhausen, who finds, in the very
greatness and fixity of orientation of the development
in the Law and in the figure of the Lawgiver, a conclusive
proof of the rich reality and greatness of the
Man of God, Moses. Yet it is Hermann Gunkel, I think,
who has reached the best balanced judgement in this
matter. With Gunkel we can securely hold that Moses
called God Yahweh, and proclaimed Him as the national
God of Israel; that Moses invoked Him as 'Yahweh is
my banner'&mdash;the divine leader of the Israelites in battle
(Exod. xvii. 15); and that Yahweh is for Moses a God of
righteousness&mdash;of the right and the law which he, Moses,
brought down from Mount Sinai and published at its
foot. Fierce as may now appear to us the figure of
Yahweh, thus proclaimed, yet the soul's attitude towards
Him is already here, from the first, a religion of the will:
an absolute trust in God ('Yahweh shall fight for you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and ye shall hold your peace,' Exod. xiv. 14), and a terrible
relentlessness in the execution of His commands&mdash;as when
Moses orders the sons of Levi to go to and fro in the camp,
slaying all who, as worshippers of the Golden Calf, had
not been 'on Yahweh's side' (Exod. xxxii. 25-29); and
when the chiefs, who had joined in the worship of Baal-Peor,
are 'hung up unto Yahweh before the sun' (Num.
xxv. 1-5). Long after Moses the Jews still believed in
the real existence of the gods of the heathen; and the
religion of Moses was presumably, in the first instance,
'Monolatry' (the adoration of One God among many);
but already accompanied by the conviction that Yahweh
was mightier than any other god&mdash;certainly Micah,
'Who is like Yahweh?,' is a very ancient Israelitish
name. And if Yahweh is worshipped by Moses on a
mountain (Sinai) and His law is proclaimed at a spring,
if Moses perhaps himself really fashioned the brazen
serpent as a sensible symbol of Yahweh, Yahweh nevertheless
remains without visible representation in or on
the Ark; He is never conceived as the sheer equivalent
of natural forces; and all mythology is absent here&mdash;the
vehement rejection of the calf-worship shows this
strikingly. Michael Angelo, himself a soul of fire, understood
Moses well, Gunkel thinks.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The second period, from Elijah's first public appearance
(about 860 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) to the Dedication of the Second Temple
(516 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), and on to the public subscription to the Law
of Moses, under Ezra (in 444 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), is surpassed, in spiritual
richness and importance, only by the classical times of
Christianity itself. Its beginning, its middle, and its end
each possess distinctive characters.</p>

<p>The whole opens with Elijah, 'the grandest heroic
figure in all the Bible,' as it still breathes and burns in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the First Book of Kings. 'For Elijah there existed not,
in different regions, forces possessed of equal rights and
equal claims to adoration, but everywhere only one
Holy Power that revealed Itself, not like Baal, in the life
of Nature, but like Yahweh, in the moral demands of the
Spirit' (Wellhausen).</p>

<p>And then (in about 750 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) appears Amos, the first
of the noble 'storm-birds' who herald the coming national
destructions and divine survivals. 'Yahweh was for
these prophets above all the god of justice, and God of
Israel only in so far as Israel satisfied His demands of
justice. And yet the special relation of Yahweh to Israel
is still recognized as real; the ethical truth, which now
stood high above Israel, had, after all, arisen within
Israel and could still only be found within it.' The two
oldest lengthy narrative documents of the Pentateuch&mdash;the
Yahwist (J) and the Ephraemite (E)&mdash;appear to have
been composed, the first in Judah in the time of Elijah,
the second in Israel in the time of Amos. J gives us the
immortal stories of Paradise and the Fall, Cain and Abel,
Noah and the Flood; E, Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac;
and the documents conjointly furnish the more na&iuml;ve and
picturesque parts of the grand accounts of the Patriarchs
generally&mdash;the first great narrative stage of the Pentateuch.
God here gives us some of His most exquisite
self-revelations through the Israelitish peasant-soul. And
Isaiah of Jerusalem, successful statesman as well as deep
seer, still vividly lives for us in some thirty-six chapters of
that great collection the 'Book of Isaiah' (i-xii, xv-xx, xxii-xxxix).
There is his majestic vocation in about 740 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
described by himself, without ambiguity, as a precise,
objective revelation (chap. vi); and there is the divinely
impressive close of his long and great activity, when he
nerves King Hezekiah to refuse the surrender of the Holy
City to the all-powerful Sennacherib, King of Assyria:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that Yahweh would not allow a single arrow to be shot
against it, and would turn back the Assyrian by the way
by which he came&mdash;all which actually happens as thus
predicted (chap. xxxvii).</p>

<p>The middle of this rich second period is filled by
a great prophet-priest's figure, and a great prophetical
priestly reform. Jeremiah is called in 628 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and dies
obscurely in Egypt in about 585 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; and the Deuteronomic
Law and Book is found in the Temple, and is solemnly
proclaimed to, and accepted by, the people, under the
leadership of the High Priest Hilkiah and King Josiah,
'the Constantine of the Jewish Church,' in 628 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Jeremiah and Deuteronomy (D) are strikingly cognate
in style, temper, and injunctions; and especially D contrasts
remarkably in all this with the documents J and E.
We thus have here the second great development of the
Mosaic Law. Both Jeremiah and Deuteronomy possess
a deeply interior, tenderly spiritual, kernel and a fiercely
polemical husk&mdash;they both are full of the contrast
between the one All-Holy God to be worshipped in the
one Holy Place, Jerusalem, and the many impure
heathen gods worshipped in so many places by the Jewish
crowd. Thus in Jeremiah Yahweh declares: 'This shall
be my covenant that I will make with the house of Israel:
I will write my law in their hearts: and they shall all
know me, from the least to the greatest: for I will remember
their sin no more' (xxxi. 33, 34). And Yahweh
exclaims: 'My people have committed two evils: they
have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have
hewn out cisterns that can hold no water.' 'Lift up thine
eyes unto the high places ... thou hast polluted the land
with thy wickedness.' 'Wilt thou not from this time
cry unto me: My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?'
(ii. 13, iii. 2, 4). And Deuteronomy teaches magnificently:
'This commandment which I command you this day, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. It is not in
heaven, neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest
say: Who shall go up for us to heaven or over the sea,
and bring it unto us? But the word is very nigh unto
thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest
do it' (xxx. 11-14). And there are here exquisite injunctions&mdash;to
bring back stray cattle to their owners; to
spare the sitting bird, where eggs or fledglings are found;
to leave over, at the harvest, some of the grain, olives,
grapes, for the stranger, the orphan, the widow; and not
to muzzle the ox when treading out the corn (xxii. 1, 6, 7;
xxiv. 19; xxv. 4). Yet the same Deuteronomy ordains:
'If thine own brother, son, daughter, wife, or bosom
friend entice thee secretly, saying, let us go and serve
other gods, thine hand shall be first upon him to put him
to death.' Also 'There shall not be found with thee any
consulter with a familiar spirit ... or a necromancer.
Yahweh thy God doth drive them out before thee.' And,
finally, amongst the laws of war, 'of the cities of these
people (Hittite, Amorite, Canaanite, Perizzite, Hivite,
Jebusite) thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth,
as Yahweh thy God hath commanded thee' (xii. 2-5;
xiii. 6, 9; xviii. 10-13; xx. 16, 17). Here we must
remember that the immorality of these Canaanitish tribes
and cults was of the grossest, indeed largely unnatural,
kind; that it had copiously proved its terrible fascination
for their kinsmen, the Jews; that these ancient Easterns,
e.g. the Assyrians, were ruthlessly cruel at the storming
of enemy cities; and especially that the morality and
spirituality, thus saved for humanity from out of a putrid
flood, was (in very deed) immensely precious. One point
here is particularly far-sighted&mdash;the severe watchfulness
against all animism, spiritualism, worship of the dead,
things in which the environing world of the Jews' fellow
Semites was steeped. The Israelitish-Jewish prophetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
movement did not first attain belief in a Future Life, and
then, through this, belief in God; but the belief in God,
strongly hostile to all those spiritualisms, only very
slowly, and not until the danger of any infusion of those
naturalisms had become remote, led on the Jews to
a realization of the soul's survival with a consciousness
at least equal to its earthly aliveness. The Second Book
of Kings (chaps. xxii, xxiii) gives a graphic account of
King Josiah's rigorous execution of the Deuteronomic law.</p>

<p>The end of this most full second period is marked by
the now rapid predominance of a largely technical priestly
legislation and a corresponding conception of past history;
by the inception of the Synagogue and the religion of the
Book; but also by writings the most profound of any
in the Old Testament, all presumably occasioned by the
probing experiences of the Exile. In 597 and 586 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Jerusalem is destroyed and the majority of the Jews are
taken captives to Babylon; and in between (in 593) occurs
the vocation of the prophet-priest Ezekiel, and his book
is practically complete by 573 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Here the prophecies
as to the restoration are strangely detailed and schematic&mdash;already
somewhat like the apocalyptic writers. Yet
Ezekiel reveals to us deathless truths&mdash;the responsibility
of the individual soul for its good and its evil, and God
Himself as the Good Shepherd of the lost and the sick
(xviii. 20-32; xxxiv. 1-6); he gives us the grand pictures
of the resurrection unto life of the dead bones of Israel
(chap. xxxvii), and of the waters of healing and of life
which flow forth, ever deeper and wider, from beneath
the Temple, and by their sweetness transform all sour
waters and arid lands that they touch (xlvii. 1-12).
A spirit and doctrine closely akin to those of Ezekiel
produced the third, last, and most extensive development
of the Pentateuchal legislation and doctrinal history&mdash;in
about 560 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the Law of Holiness (Lev., chaps. xvii<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>-xxvi);
and in about 500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the Priestly Code. As with
Ezekiel's look forward, so here with these Priests' look
backward, we have to recognize much schematic precision
of dates, genealogies, and explanations instinct with
technical interests. The unity of sanctuary and the
removal from the feasts and the worship of all traces of
naturalism, which in Jeremiah, Deuteronomy, and the
Second Book of Kings appear still as the subject-matters
of intensest effort and conflict, are here assumed as
operative even back to patriarchal times. Yet it can
reasonably be pleaded that the life-work of Moses truly
involved all this development; and even that Monotheism
(at least, for the times and peoples here concerned)
required some such rules as are assumed by P throughout.</p>

<p>And P gives us the great six days' Creation Story with
its splendid sense of rational order pervasive of the
Universe, the work of the all-reasonable God&mdash;its single
parts good, its totality very good; and man and woman
springing together from the Creator's will. But the
writer nowhere indicates that he means long periods by
the 'days'; each creation appears as effected in an
instant, and these instants as separated from each other
by but twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>In between Deuteronomy and the Priestly Code, or
a little later still, lies probably the composition of three
religious works full, respectively, of exultant thanksgiving,
of the noblest insight into the fruitfulness of suffering,
and of the deepest questionings issuing in childlike trust
in God. For an anonymous writer composes (say, in
550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) the great bulk of the magnificent chapters
forty to fifty-five of our Book of Isaiah&mdash;a paean of
spiritual exultation over the Jews' proximate deliverance
from exile by the Persian King Cyrus. In 538 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Cyrus issues the edict for the restoration to Judaea, and
in 516 the Second Temple is dedicated. Within this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
great Consolation stand (xlii. 1-4; xlix. 1-6; l. 4-9;
lii. 13-liii. 12) the four poems on the Suffering Servant
of Yahweh&mdash;the tenderest revelation of the Old Testament&mdash;apparently
written previously in the Exile, say
in 570-560 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The Old Law here reaches to the very
feet of the New Law&mdash;to the Lamb of God who taketh
away the sins of the world. And the Book of Job, in
its chief constituents (chaps. i-xxxi, xxxviii-xlii), was
probably composed when Greek influences began&mdash;say in
about 480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the year of the battle of Thermopylae.
The canonization of this daringly speculative book
indicates finely how sensitive even the deepest faith and
holiness can remain to the apparently unjust distribution
of man's earthly lot.</p>

<p>Our second period ends in 444 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the priest
and scribe Ezra solemnly proclaims, and receives the
public subscription to, the Book of the Law of Moses&mdash;the
Priestly Code, brought by him from Babylon.</p>

<p>The Jewish last period, from Ezra's Proclamation
444 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to the completion of the Fourth Book of Ezra,
about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 95, is (upon the whole) derivative. Amos,
Isaiah, Jeremiah were absorbed in the realities of their
own epoch-making times, and of God's universal governance
of the world past and future; Daniel now, with
practically all the other Apocalyptic writers in his train,
is absorbed in those earlier prophecies, and in ingenious
speculations and precise computations as to the how and
the when of the world's ending. The Exile had given
rise to the Synagogue, and had favoured the final development
and codifying of the Mosaic law; the seventy years
intermission of the Temple sacrifices and symbolic acts
had turned the worship, which had been so largely
visible, dramatic, social, into the praying, singing, reading,
preaching of extant texts, taken as direct and final rules
for all thought and action, and as incapable of additions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or interpretations equal in value to themselves. Yet thus
priceless treasures of spiritual truth and light were handed
down to times again aglow with great&mdash;the greatest
religious gifts and growths; and indeed this literature
itself introduced various conceptions or images destined
to form a largely fitting, and in the circumstances attractive,
garment for the profound further realities brought
by Christianity.</p>

<p>In the Book of Daniel (written somewhere between
163 and 165 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) all earthly events appear as already
inscribed in the heavenly books (vii. 10), and the events
which have still really to come consist in the complete
and speedy triumph of the Church-State Israel against
King Antiochus Epiphanes. But here we get the earliest
clear proclamation of a heightened life beyond death&mdash;though
not yet for all (xii. 2). The noble vision of the
four great beasts that came up from the sea, and of one
like unto a Son of Man that came with the clouds of
heaven (chap. vii), doubtless here figures the earthly
kingdoms, Babel, Media, Persia, Greece (Alexander), and
God's kingdom Israel. The Psalter appears to have been
closed as late as 140 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; some Psalms doubtless date
back to 701&mdash;a few perhaps to David himself, about
1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The comminatory Psalms, even if spoken as
by representatives of God's Church and people, we cannot
now echo within our own spiritual life; any heightened
consciousness after death is frequently denied (e.g. vi. 5:
'in the grave who shall give thee thanks?' and cxv. 17:
'the dead praise not the Lord')&mdash;we have seen the impressive
reason of this; and perhaps a quarter of the
Psalms are doubles, or pale imitations of others. But,
for the rest, the Psalter remains as magnificently fresh
and powerful as ever: culminating in the glorious self-commitment
(Ps. lxxiii), 'I was as a beast before Thee.
Nevertheless I am continually with Thee. Whom have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
I in heaven but Thee, and there is none upon earth
that I desire beside Thee.' The keen sense, present
throughout this amazingly rich collection, of the reality,
prevenience, presence, protection&mdash;of the central importance
for man, of God, the All-Abiding, finds thus its full,
deathless articulation.</p>

<p>Religiously slighter, yet interesting as a preparation
for Christian theology, are the writings of Philo, a devout,
Greek-trained Jew of Alexandria, who in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 40 appeared
before the Emperor Caligula in Rome. Philo does not
feel his daringly allegorical sublimations as any departures
from the devoutest Biblical faith. Thus 'God
never ceases from action; as to burn is special to fire, so
is action to God'&mdash;this in spite of God's rest on the seventh
day (Gen. ii. 2). 'There exist two kinds of men: the
heavenly man and the earthly man.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The long Life
of Moses<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> represents him as the King, Lawgiver, High
Priest, Prophet, Mediator. The Word, the Logos (which
here everywhere hovers near, but never reaches, personality)
is 'the firstborn son of God', 'the image of
God'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; its types are 'the Rock', the Manna, the High
Priest's Coat; it is 'the Wine Pourer and Master of the
Drinking Feast of God'.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The majority of the Jews,
who did not accept Jesus as the Christ, soon felt they
had no need for so much allegory, and dropped it, with
advantage upon the whole, to the Jewish faith. But
already St. Paul and the Fourth Gospel find here noble
mental raiment for the great new facts revealed by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>2. The Christian Religion we will take, as to our points,
at four stages of its development&mdash;Synoptic, Johannine,
Augustinian, Thomistic.</p>

<p>The Synoptic material here specially concerned we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
shall find especially in Mark i. 1 to xv. 47; but also in
Matt. iii. 1 to xxvii. 56, and in Luke iii. 1 to xxiii. 56.
Within the material thus marked off, there is no greater
or lesser authenticity conferred by treble, or double, or
only single attestation; for this material springs from
two original sources&mdash;a collection primarily of doings
and sufferings, which our Mark incorporates with some
expansions; and a collection primarily of discourses,
utilized especially by Matthew and Luke in addition to
the original Mark. Both these sources contain the records
of eyewitnesses, probably Saints Peter and Matthew.</p>

<p>The chronological order and the special occasions of
the growths in our Lord's self-manifestation, or in the
self-consciousness of His human soul, are most carefully
given by Mark and next by Luke. Matthew largely
ignores the stages and occasions of both these growths,
and assumes, as fully explicit from the beginning of the
Ministry, what was manifested only later on or at the last;
and he already introduces ecclesiastical and Christological
terms and discriminations which, however really implicit
as to their substance in Jesus's teaching, or inevitable
(as to their particular form) for the maintenance and
propagation of Christianity in the near future, are nevertheless
still absent from the accounts of Mark and Luke.</p>

<p>The chief rules for the understanding of the specific
character of our Lord's revelation appear to be the
following. The life and teaching must be taken entire;
and, within this entirety, each stage must be apprehended
in its own special peculiarities. The thirty years in the
home, the school, the synagogue, the workshop at
Nazareth, form a profoundly important constituent of
His life and teaching&mdash;impressively contrasted, as they
are, with the probably not full year of the Public
Ministry, even though we are almost completely bereft
of all details for those years of silent preparation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Public Ministry, again, consists of two strongly
contrasted stages, divided by the great scene of Jesus
with the Apostles alone at Caesarea Philippi (Mark viii.
27-33; Luke ix. 18-22; Matt. xvi. 13-23). The stage
before is predominantly expansive, hopeful, peacefully
growing; the stage after, is concentrated, sad, in conflict,
and in storm. To the first stage belong the plant parables,
full of exquisite sympathy with the unfolding of natural
beauty and of slow fruitfulness; to the second stage
belong the parables of keen watchfulness and of the
proximate, sudden second coming. Both movements are
essential to the physiognomy of our Lord. And they
are not simply differences in self-manifestation; they
represent a growth, a relatively new element, in His
human soul's experience and outlook.</p>

<p>The central doctrine in the teaching is throughout
the Kingdom of God. But in the first stage this central
doctrine appears as especially upheld by Jesus's fundamental
experience&mdash;the Fatherhood of God. In the
second stage the central doctrine appears as especially
coloured by Jesus's other great experience&mdash;of Himself
as the Son of Man. In the earlier stage the Kingdom
is presented more in the spirit of the ancient prophets,
as predominantly ethical, as already come in its beginnings,
and as subject to laws analogous to those obtaining
in the natural world. In the second stage the coming
of the Kingdom is presented more with the form of the
apocalyptic writers, in a purely religious, intensely
transcendent, and dualistic outlook&mdash;especially this also
in the Parables of Immediate Expectation&mdash;as not present
but future (Matt. xix. 28); not distant but imminent
(Matt. xvi. 28; xxiv. 33; xxvi. 64); not gradual but
sudden (Matt. xxiv. 27, 39, 43); not at all achieved by
man but purely given by God (so still in Rev. xxi. 10).</p>

<p>To the earlier stage belongs the great Rejoicing of Jesus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
(Matt. xi. 25-30; Luke x. 21, 22). The splendid opening,
'I thank Thee, Father&mdash;for so it hath seemed good in
Thy sight', and the exquisite close, special to Matthew,
'Come unto Me&mdash;and my burthen is light', raise no grave
difficulty. But the intermediate majestic declaration,
'All things are delivered unto Me by the Father&mdash;neither
knoweth any man the Father save the Son and he to
whomsoever the Son will reveal him', causes critical
perplexities.</p>

<p>I take this declaration to be modelled upon actual
words of Jesus, which genuinely implied rather than
clearly proclaimed a unique relation between the Father
and Himself. Numerous other words and acts involve
such a relation and Jesus's full consciousness of it. His
first public act, His baptism, is clearly described by Mark
as a personal experience, 'He saw the heavens opened'
and heard a heavenly voice 'Thou art my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased' (i. 10, 11). Already in the
first stage Jesus declares the Baptist to be 'more than
a prophet' (Matt. xi. 9), yet claims superiority over him
and over Solomon (xi. 11; xii. 42). His doctrine is new
wine requiring new bottles (Mark ii. 22); indeed His
whole attitude towards the law is that of a superior, who
most really exhorts all, 'Learn of Me'. And soon after
Caesarea Philippi He insists to the people: 'Whosoever
shall be ashamed of Me in this generation, of him also shall
the Son of Man be ashamed, when He cometh in the
glory of the Father' (Mark viii. 38). The most numerous
cures, physical, psychical, moral, certainly performed by
Him, appear as the spontaneous effect of a unique degree
and kind of spiritual authority; and the sinlessness
attributed to Him throughout by the apostolic community
(2 Cor. v. 21; Heb. iv. 15; John viii. 46; 1 John ii. 29)
entirely corresponds to the absence, in the records of
Him, of all traits indicating troubles of conscience and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the corresponding fear of God. And this His unique
Sonship is conjoined, in the earliest picture of Him, with
an endless variety and combination of all the joys,
admirations, affections, disappointments, desolations,
temptations possible to such a stainless human soul
and will. We thus find here a comprehensiveness unlike
the attitude of the Baptist or St. Paul, and like, although
far exceeding, the joy in nature and the peace in suffering
of St. Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>The Second Stage opens with the great scene at Caesarea
Philippi and its sequel (given with specially marked
successiveness in Mark viii. 27-x. 45), when, for the first
time in a manner beyond all dispute, Mark represents
Jesus as adopting the designation 'the Son of Man' in
a Messianic and eschatological sense. For our Lord
here promptly corrects Peter's conception of 'Messiah'
by repeated insistence upon 'the Son of Man'&mdash;His
glory yet also His sufferings. Thus Jesus adopts the
term of Daniel vii. 13 (which already the Apocalypse
of Enoch had understood of a personal Messiah) as
a succinct description of His specific vocation&mdash;its
heavenly origin and difference from all earthly Messianism;
its combination of the depths of human weakness,
dereliction, sufferings with the highest elevation in joy,
power and glory; and its connexion of that pain with
this triumph as strictly interrelated&mdash;only with and
through the Cross, was there here the offer and acceptance
of the Crown.</p>

<p>As to the Passion and Death, and the Risen Life, four
points appear to be central and secured. Neither the
Old Testament nor Jewish Theology really knew of a
Suffering Messiah. Jesus Himself clearly perceived,
accepted, and carried out this profound new revelation.
This suffering and death were conceived by Him as the
final act and crown of His service&mdash;so in Mark x. 44, 45<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and Luke xxii. 24-7. (All this remains previous to, and
independent of, St. Paul's elaborated doctrine as to the
strictly vicarious and juridical character of the whole.)
And the Risen Life is an objectively real, profoundly
operative life&mdash;the visions of the Risen One were effects
of the truly living Jesus, the Christ.</p>

<p>The Second Christian Stage, the Johannine writings,
are fully understandable only as posterior to St. Paul&mdash;the
most enthusiastic and influential, indeed, of all our
Lord's early disciples, but a convert, from the activity
of a strict persecuting Pharisee, not to the earthly Jesus,
of soul and body, whom he never knew, but to the
heavenly Spirit-Christ, whom he had so suddenly experienced.
Saul, the man of violent passions and acute
interior conflicts, thus abruptly changed in a substantially
<i>pneumatic</i> manner, is henceforth absorbed, not in the
past Jewish Messiah, but in the present universal Christ;
not in the Kingdom of God, but in Pneuma, the Spirit.
Christ, the second Adam, is here a life-giving Spirit,
an element that surrounds and penetrates the human
spirit; we are baptized, dipped, into Christ, Spirit; we
can drink Christ, the Spirit. And this Christ-Spirit
effects and maintains the universal brotherhood of mankind,
and articulates in particular posts and functions
the several human spirits, as variously necessary members
of the one Christian society and Church.</p>

<p>Now the Johannine Gospel indeed utilizes considerable
Synoptic materials, and does not, as St. Paul, restrict
itself to the Passion and Resurrection. Yet it gives us,
substantially, the Spirit-Christ, the Heavenly Man; and
the growth, prayer, temptation, appeal for sympathy,
dereliction, agony, which, in the Synoptists, are still so
real for the human soul of Jesus Himself, appear here as
sheer condescensions, in time and space, of Him who,
as all things good, descends from the Eternal Above, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that we men here below may ascend thither with Him.
On the other hand, the Church and the Sacraments,
still predominantly implicit in the Synoptists, and the
subjects of costly conflict and organization in the Pauline
writings, here underlie, as already fully operative facts,
practically the entire profound work. The great dialogue
with Nicodemus concerns Baptism; the great discourse
in the synagogue at Capernaum, the Holy Eucharist&mdash;in
both cases, the strict need of these Sacraments. And
from the side of the dead Jesus flow blood and water,
as those two great Sacraments flow from the everliving
Christ; whilst at the Cross's foot He leaves His seamless
coat, symbol of the Church's indivisible unity. The
Universalism of this Gospel is not merely apparent:
'God so loved the world' (iii. 16), 'the Saviour of the
world' (iv. 42)&mdash;this glorious teaching is traceable in
many a passage. Yet Christ here condemns the Jews&mdash;in
the Synoptists only the Pharisees; He is from above,
they are from below; all those that came before Him
were thieves and robbers; He will not pray for the world&mdash;'ye
shall die in your sins' (xvii. 9; viii. 24); and the
commandment, designated here by Jesus as His own and
as new, to 'love one another', is for and within the
community to which He gives His 'example' (xv. 12;
xiii. 34)&mdash;in contrast with the great double commandment
of love proclaimed by Him, in the Synoptists, as already
formulated in the Mosaic Law (Mark xii. 28-34), and
as directly applicable to every fellow-man&mdash;indeed, a
schismatic Samaritan is given as the pattern of such
perfect love (Luke x. 25-37).</p>

<p>Deuteronomy gained its full articulation in conflict
with Canaanite impurity; the Johannine writings take
shape during the earlier battles of the long war with
Gnosticism&mdash;the most terrible foe ever, so far, encountered
by the Catholic Church, and conquered by her in open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and fair fight. Also these writings lay much stress upon
Knowing and the Truth: 'this is life eternal, to know
Thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Thou
hast sent' (xvii. 3); symbolism and mysticism prevail
very largely; and, in so far as they are not absorbed in
an Eternal Present, the reception of truth and experience
is not limited to Christ's earthly sojourn&mdash;'the Father
will give you another Helper, the spirit of truth who will
abide with you forever' (xiv. 16). Yet here the knowing
and the truth are also deeply ethical and social: 'he who
doeth the truth cometh to the light' (iii. 21); and Christ
has a fold, and other sheep not of this fold&mdash;them also
He must bring, there will be one fold, one Shepherd;
indeed, ministerial gradations exist in this one Church
(so in xiii. 5-10; xx. 3-8; xxi. 7-19). And the Mysticism
here is but an emotional intuitive apprehension of the
great historical figure of Jesus, and of the most specifically
religious of all facts&mdash;of the already overflowing operative
existence, previous to all our action, of God, the Prevenient
Love. 'Not we loved God (first), but He (first)
loved us,' 'let us love Him, because He first loved us,'
'no man can come to Me, unless the Father draw him'&mdash;a
drawing which awakens a hunger and thirst for Christ
and God (1 John iv. 10, 19; John vi. 44; iv. 14; vi. 35).</p>

<p>The Third Stage we can find in St. Augustine, who,
born a North African Roman (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 354) and a convert
from an impure life and Manichaeism, with its spatially
extended God (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 386), wrote his <i>Confessions</i> in 397,
lived to experience the capture and sack of Rome by Alaric
the Goth, 410, composed his great work, <i>The City of God</i>,
amidst the clear dissolution of a mighty past and the dim
presage of a problematical future, and died at Hippo, his
episcopal city, in 430, whilst the Vandals were besieging
it. St. Augustine is more largely a convert and a rigorist
even than St. Paul when St. Paul is most incisive. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
here he shall testify only to the natures of Eternity and
of real time, a matter in which he remains unequalled
in the delicate vividness and balance of his psychological
analysis and religious perception. 'Thou, O God, precedest
all past times by the height of Thine ever-present
Eternity; and Thou exceedest all future times,
since they <i>are</i> future, and, once they have come, will
be past times. All thy years abide together, because
they abide; but these our years will all be, only when
they all will have ceased to be. Thy years are but One
Day&mdash;not every day, but To-Day. This Thy To-Day
is Eternity'.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The human soul, even in this life, has
moments of a vivid apprehension of Eternity, as in the
great scene of Augustine and Monica at the window in
Ostia.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> And this our sense of Eternity, Beatitude, God,
proceeds at bottom from Himself, immediately present
in our lives; the succession, duration of man is sustained
by the Simultaneity, the Eternity of God: 'this day of
ours <i>does</i> pass within Thee, since all these things' of our
deeper experience 'have no means of passing unless,
somehow, Thou dost contain them all'. 'Behold, Thou
wast within, and I was without ... Thou wast with me,
but I was not with Thee.' 'Is not the blessed life precisely
<i>that</i> life which all men desire? Even those who only
hope to be blessed would not, unless they in some manner
already possessed the blessed life, desire to be blessed, as,
in reality, it is most certain that they desire to be.'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Especially satisfactory is the insistence upon the futility
of the question as to what God was doing in Time before
He created. Time is only a quality inherent in all creatures;
it never existed of itself.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>And our fourth, last Christian Stage shall be represented
by St. Thomas Aquinas (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1225-74), in the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
great question where this Norman-Italian Friar Noble,
a soul apparently so largely derivative and abstractive,
is more complete and balanced, and penetrates to the
specific genius of Christianity more deeply, than Saints
Paul and Augustine with all their greater directness and
intensity. We saw how the deepest originality of our
Lord's teaching and temper consisted in His non-rigoristic
earnestness, in His non-Gnostic detachment from things
temporal and spatial. The absorbing expectation of the
Second Coming, indeed the old, largely effete Graeco-Roman
world, had first to go, the great Germanic migrations
had to be fully completed, the first Crusades had
to pass, before&mdash;some twelve centuries after Nazareth
and Calvary&mdash;Christianity attained in Aquinas a systematic
and promptly authoritative expression of this its
root-peculiarity and power. No one has put the point
better than Professor E. Troeltsch: 'The decisive point
here is the conception, peculiar to the Middle Ages, of
what is Christian as Supernatural, or rather the full
elaboration of the consequences involved in the conception
of the Supernatural. The Supernatural is now recognized
not only in the great complicated miracle of man's
redemption from out of the world corrupted by original
sin. But the Supernatural now unfolds itself as an
autonomous principle of a logical, religious and ethical
kind. The creature, even the perfect creature, is only
Natural&mdash;is possessed of only natural laws and ends;
God alone is Supernatural. Hence the essence of Christian
Supernaturalism consists in the elevation of the creature,
above this creature's co-natural limitations, to God's
own Supernature'. The distinction is no longer, as in
the Ancient Church, between two kinds (respectively
perfect and relative) of the one sole Natural Law; the
distinction here is between Natural Law in general and
Supernature generally. 'The Decalogue, in strictness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is not yet the Christian Ethic. "Biblical" now means
revealed, but not necessarily Christian; for the Bible
represents, according to Aquinas, a process of development
which moves through universal history and possesses
various stages. The Decalogue is indeed present in the
legislation of Christ, but as a stage preliminary to the
specifically Christian Ethic. The formula, on the contrary,
for the specifically Christian Moral Law is here the
Augustinian definition of the love of God as the highest
and absolute, the entirely simple, Moral end&mdash;an end
which contains the demand of the love of God in the
stricter sense (self-sanctification, self-denial, contemplation)
and the demand of the love of our neighbour (the
active relating of all to God, the active interrelating of
all in God, and the most penetrating, mutual self-sacrifice
for God). This Ethic, a mystical interpretation of the
Evangelical Preaching, forms indeed a strong contrast
to the This-World Ethic of the Natural Law, Aristotle,
the Decalogue and Natural Prosperity; but then this
cannot fail to be the case, given the entire fundamental
character of the Christian Ethic'.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Thus the widest and most primitive contrasts here are,
not Sin and Redemption (though these, of course, remain)
but Nature (however good in its kind) and Supernature.
The State becomes the complex of that essentially good
thing, Nature; the Church the complex of that different,
higher good, Supernature; roughly speaking, where the
State leaves off, the Church begins.</p>

<p>It lasted not long, before the Canonists and certain
ruling Churchmen helped to break up, in the consciousness
of men at large, this noble perception of the two-step
ladder from God to man and from man to God. And the
Protestant Reformers, as a whole, went even beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Saints Paul and Augustine in exclusive preoccupation
with Sin and Redemption. Henceforth the single-step
character of man's call now more than ever predominates.
The Protestant Reformation, like the French Revolution,
marks the existence of grave abuses, the need of large
reforms, and, especially on this point, the all but inevitable
excessiveness of man once he is aroused to such 'reforming'
action. Certainly, to this hour, Protestantism
as such has produced, within and for religion specifically,
nothing that can seriously compare, in massive, balanced
completeness, with the work of the short-lived golden
Middle Ages of Aquinas and Dante. Hence, for our
precise present purpose, we can conclude our Jewish
and Christian survey here.</p>

<p>3. Only a few words about Confucianism, Buddhism,
Mohammedanism, as these, in some of their main outlines,
illustrate the points especially brought out by the Jewish
Christian development.</p>

<p>Confucianism admittedly consists, at least as we have
it, in a greatly complicated system of the direct worship
of Nature (Sun, Moon, Stars especially) and of Ancestors,
and of a finely simple system of ethical rules for
man's ordinary social intercourse. That Nature-worship
closely resembles what the Deuteronomic reform fought
so fiercely in Israel; and the immemorial antiquity and
still vigorous life of such a worship in China indicates
impressively how little such Nature-worship tends, of
itself, to its own supersession by a definite Theism. And
the Ethical Rules, and their very large observance,
illustrate well how real can be the existence, and the
goodness in its own kind, of Natural, This-World morality,
even where it stands all but entirely unpenetrated or
supplemented by any clear and strong supernatural
attraction or conviction.</p>

<p>Buddhism, in its original form, consisted neither in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the Wheel of Reincarnation alone, nor in <i>Nirvana</i> alone,
but precisely in the combination of the two; for that
ceaseless flux of reincarnation was there felt with such
horror, that the <i>Nirvana</i>&mdash;the condition in which that
flux is abolished&mdash;was hailed as a blessed release. The
judgement as to the facts&mdash;that all human experience
is of sheer, boundless change&mdash;was doubtless excessive;
but the value-judgement&mdash;that if life be such pure
shiftingness, then the cessation of life is the one end for
man to work and pray for&mdash;was assuredly the authentic
cry of the human soul when fully normal and awake.
This position thus strikingly confirms the whole Jewish
and Christian persistent search for permanence in change&mdash;for
a Simultaneity, the support of our succession.</p>

<p>And Mohammedanism, both in its striking achievements
and in its marked limitations, indeed also in the presentations
of it by its own spokesmen, appears as a religion
primarily not of a special pervasive spirit and of large,
variously applicable maxims, but as one of precise,
entirely immutable rules. Thus we find here something
not all unlike, but mostly still more rigid than, the post-Exilic
Jewish religion&mdash;something doubtless useful for
certain times and races, but which could not expand and
adapt itself to indefinite varieties of growths and peoples
without losing that interior unity and self-identity so
essential to all living and powerful religion.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Let us now attempt, in a somewhat loose and elastic
order, a short allocation and estimate of the facts in past
and present religion which mainly concern the question
of Religion and Progress.</p>

<p>We West Europeans have apparently again reached
the fruitful stage when man is not simply alive to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or that physical or psychic need, nor even to the practical
interest and advantage of this or that Art, Science,
Sociology, Politics, Ethics; but when he awakens further
to the question as to why and how these several activities,
all so costly where at all effectual, can deserve all this
sacrifice&mdash;can be based in anything sufficiently abiding
and objective. The history of all the past efforts, and
indeed all really adequate richness of immediate outlook,
combine, I think, to answer that only the experience
and the conviction of an Objective Reality distinct from,
and more than, man, or indeed than the whole of the
world apprehended by man as less than, or as equal to,
man himself, can furnish sufficiently deep and tenacious
roots for our sense and need of an objective supreme
Beauty, Truth, and Goodness&mdash;of a living Reality already
overflowing that which, in lesser degrees and ways, we
small realities cannot altogether cease from desiring to
become. It is Religion which, from first to last, but with
increasing purity and power, brings with it this evidence
and conviction. Its sense of the Objective, Full Reality
of God, and its need of Adoration are quite essential to
Religion, although considerable systems, which are largely
satisfactory in the more immediate questions raised by
Aesthetics and even by Ethics, and which are sincerely
anxious to do justice also to the religious sense, are fully
at work to explain away these essential characteristics of
all wideawake Religion. Paul Natorp, the distinguished
Plato-scholar in Germany, the short-lived pathetically
eloquent M. Guyau in France, and, above all, Benedetto
Croce, the large encyclopaedic mind in Italy, have influenced
or led much of this movement, which, in questions
of Religion, has assuredly not reached the deepest and
most tenacious teachings of life.</p>

<p>The intimations as to this deepest Reality certainly
arise within my own mind, emotion, will; and these my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
faculties cannot, upon the whole, be constrained by my
fellow mortals; indeed, as men grow more manysidedly
awake, all attempts at any such constraint only arrest
or deflect the growth of these intimations. Yet the
dispositions necessary for the sufficient apprehension of
these religious intimations&mdash;sincerity, conscientiousness,
docility&mdash;are not, even collectively, already Religion, any
more than they are Science or Philosophy. With these
dispositions on our part, objective facts and living
Reality can reach us&mdash;and, even so, these facts reach us
practically always, at first, through human teachers
already experienced in these things. The need of such
facts and such persons to teach them are, in the first
years of every man, and for long ages in the history
of mankind, far more pressing than any question of
toleration. Even vigorous persecution or keen exclusiveness
of feeling have&mdash;<i>pace</i> Lord Acton&mdash;saved for mankind,
at certain crises of its difficult development, convictions
of priceless worth&mdash;as in the Deuteronomic Reform
and the Johannine Writings. In proportion as men
become more manysidedly awake, they acquire at least
the capacity for greater sensitiveness concerning the
laws and forces intrinsic to the various ranges and
levels of life; and, where such sensitiveness is really
at work, it can advantageously replace, by means of
the spontaneous acceptance of such objective realities,
the constraints of past ages&mdash;constraints which now,
in any case, have become directly mischievous for such
minds. None the less will men, after this change as before,
require the corporate experience and manifestation of
religion as, in varying degrees and ways, a permanent
necessity for the vigorous life of religion. Indeed, such
corporate tradition operates strongly even where men's
spiritual sense seems most individual, or where, with the
retention of some ethical nobility of outlook, they most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
keenly combat all and every religious institution. So with
George Fox's doctrine of the Divine Enlightenment of
every soul separately and without mediation of any kind,
a doctrine derived by him from that highly ecclesiastical
document, the Gospel of St. John; and with many
a Jacobin's fierce proclamation of the rights of Man,
never far away from reminiscences of St. Paul.</p>

<p>This permanent necessity of Religious Institutions is
primarily a need for men to teach and exemplify, not
simply Natural, This-World Morality, but a Supernatural,
Other-World Ethic; and not simply that abstraction,
Religion in General or a Religious Hypothesis, but that
rich concretion, this or that Historical Religion. In
proportion as such an Historical Religion is deep and
delicate, it will doubtless contain affinities with all that
is wholesome and real within the other extant historical
religions. Nevertheless, all religions are effectual through
their special developments, where these developments
remain true at all. As well deprive a flower of its 'mere
details' of pistil, stamen, pollen, or an insect of its
'superfluous' antennae, as simplify any Historical Religion
down to the sorry stump labelled 'the religion of every
honest man'. We shall escape all bigotry, without
lapsing into such most unjust indifferentism, if we
vigorously hold and unceasingly apply the doctrine of
such a Church theologian as Juan de Lugo. De Lugo
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1583-1660), Spaniard, post-Reformation Roman
Catholic, Jesuit, Theological Professor, and a Cardinal
writing in Rome under the eyes of Pope Urban VIII,
teaches that the members of the various Christian sects,
of the Jewish and Mohammedan communions, and of the
heathen religions and philosophical schools, who achieve
their salvation, do so, ordinarily, simply through the aid
afforded by God's grace to their good faith in its instinctive
concentration upon, and in its practice of, those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
elements in their respective community's worship and
teaching, which are true and good and originally revealed
by God.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Thus we escape all undue individualism and
all unjust equalization of the (very variously valuable)
religious and philosophical bodies; and yet we clearly
hold the profound importance of the single soul's good
faith and religious instinct, and of the worship or school,
be they ever so elementary and imperfect, which environ
such a soul.</p>

<p>A man's religion, in proportion to its depth, will move
in a Concrete Time which becomes more and more
a Partial Simultaneity. And these his depths then more
and more testify to, and contrast with, the Fully Simultaneous,
God. Because man thus lives, not in an ever-equal
chain of mutually exclusive moments, in Clock
Time, but in Duration, with its variously close interpenetrations
of the successive parts; and because these
interpenetrations are close in proportion to the richness
and fruitfulness of the durations he lives through; he
can, indeed he must, conceive absolutely perfect life as
absolutely simultaneous. God is thus not Unending, but
Eternal; the very fullness of His life leaves no room or
reason for succession and our poor need of it. Dr. F. C. S.
Schiller has admirably drawn out this grand doctrine,
with the aid of Aristotle's Unmoving Action, in <i>Humanism</i>,
1903, pp. 204-27. We need only persistently apprehend
this Simultaneity as essential to God, and Succession as
varyingly essential to all creatures, and there remains
no difficulty&mdash;at least as regards the Time-element&mdash;in
the doctrine of Creation. For only with the existence of
creatures does Time thus arise at all&mdash;it exists only in
and through them. And assuredly all finite things, that
we know at all, bear traces of a history involving a beginning
and an end. Professor Bernardino Varisco, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
great <i>Know Thyself</i>, has noble pages on this large
theme.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In any case we must beware of all more or less
Pantheistic conceptions of the simultaneous life of God
and the successive life of creatures as but essential and
necessary elements of one single Divine-Creaturely existence,
in the manner, e.g., of Professor Josiah Royce,
in his powerful work <i>The World and the Individual</i>,
2nd series, 1901. All such schemes break down under an
adequate realization of those dread facts error and evil.
A certain real independence must have been left by God
to reasonable creatures. And let it be noted carefully:
the great difficulty against all Theism lies in the terrible
reality of Evil; and the deepest adequacy of this same
Theism, especially of Christianity, consists in its practical
attitude towards, and success against, this most real
Evil. But Pantheism increases, whilst seeming to surmount,
the theoretical difficulty, since the world as it
stands, and not an Ultimate Reality behind it, is held
to be perfect; and it entirely fails really to transmute
Evil in practice. Theism, no more than any other outlook,
really explains Evil; but it alone, in its fullest, Jewish-Christian
forms, has done more, and better, than explain
Evil: it has fully faced, it has indeed greatly intensified,
the problem, by its noble insistence upon the reality and
heinousness of Sin; and it has then overcome all this
Evil, not indeed in theory, but in practice, by actually
producing in the midst of deep suffering, through a still
deeper faith and love, souls the living expression of the
deepest beatitude and peace.</p>

<p>The fully Simultaneous Reality awakens and satisfies
man's deepest, most nearly simultaneous life, by a certain
adaptation of its own intrinsic life to these human
spirits. In such varyingly 'incarnational' acts or action
the non-successive God Himself condescends to a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
successiveness; but this, in order to help His creatures
to achieve as much simultaneity as is compatible with
their several ranks and calls. We must not wonder if,
in the religious literature, these condescensions of God
largely appear as though they themselves were more or
less non-successive; nor, again, if the deepest religious
consciousness tends usually to conceive God's outward
action, if future, then as proximate, and, if present, then
as strictly instantaneous. For God in Himself is indeed
Simultaneous; and if we try to picture Simultaneity
by means of temporal images at all, then the instant,
and not any period long or short, is certainly nearest
to the truth&mdash;as regards the form and vehicle of the
experience.</p>

<p>The greater acts of Divine Condescension and Self-Revelation,
our Religious <i>Accessions</i>, have mostly occurred
at considerable intervals, each from the other, in our
human history. After they have actually occurred, these
several acts can be compared and arranged, according to
their chief characteristics, and even in a series of (upon
the whole) growing content and worth&mdash;hence the
Science of Religion. Yet such Science gives us no power
to produce, or even to foresee, any further acts. These
great Accessions of Spiritual Knowledge and Experience
are not the simple result of the conditions obtaining previously
in the other levels of life, or even in that of religion
itself; they often much anticipate, they sometimes
greatly lag behind, the rise or decline of the other kinds
of life. And where (as with the great Jewish Prophets,
and, in some degree, with John the Baptist and Our Lord)
these Accessions do occur at times of national stress, these
several crises are, at most, the occasion for the demand, not
the cause of the supply.</p>

<p>The mostly long gaps between these Accessions have
been more or less filled up, amongst the peoples concerned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by varyingly vigorous and valuable attempts to articulate
and systematize, to apply in practice, and rightly to
place (within the other ranges of man's total life) these
great, closely-packed masses of spiritual fact; or to
elude, to deflect, or directly to combat them, or some
of their interpretations or applications. Now fairly
steady improvement is possible, desirable, and largely
actual, in the critical sifting and appraisement, as to the
dates and the actual reality, of the historical documents
and details of these Accessions; in the philosophical
articulation of their doctrinal and evidential content;
in the finer understanding and wider application of
their ethical demands; and in the greater adequacy
(both as to firmness and comprehensiveness) of the
institutional organs and incorporations special to these
same Accessions. All this can and does progress, but
mostly slowly, intermittently, with short violent paroxysms
of excess and long sleepy reactions of defect, with one-sidedness,
travesties, and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;with worldly
indifference and self-seeking. The grace and aid of the
Simultaneous Richness are here also always necessary;
nor can these things ever really progress except through
a deep religious sense&mdash;all mere scepticism and all levelling
down are simply so much waste. Still, we can
speak of progress in the Science of Religion more appropriately
than we can of progress in the Knowledge of
Religion.</p>

<p>The Crusades, the Renaissance, the Revolution, no
doubt exercised, in the long run, so potent a secularizing
influence, because men's minds had become too largely
other-worldly&mdash;had lost a sufficient interest in this
wonderful world; and hence all those new, apparently
boundless outlooks and problems were taken up largely
as a revolt and escape from what looked like a prison-house&mdash;religion.
Yet through all these violent oscillations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
there persisted, in human life, the supernatural need and
call. In this God is the great central interest, love and
care of the soul. We must look to it that both these
interests and Ethics are kept awake, strong and distinct
within a costingly rich totality of life: the Ethic of the
honourable citizen, merchant, lawyer&mdash;of Confucius and
Socrates; and the Ethic of the Jewish Prophets at their
deepest, of the Suffering Servant, of our Lord's Beatitudes,
of St. Paul's great eulogy of love, of Augustine and Monica
at the window in Ostia, of Father Damian's voluntarily
dying a leper amidst the lepers. The Church is the born
incorporation of this pole, as the State is of the other.
The Church indeed should, at its lower limit, also encourage
the This-world Stage; the State, at its higher limit,
can, more or less consciously, prepare us for the Other-World
Stage. Both spring from the same God, at two
levels of His action; both concern the same men, at
two stages of their response and need. Yet the primary
duty of the State is turned to this life; the primary
care of the Church, to that life&mdash;to life in its deepest
depths.</p>

<p>Will men, after this great war, more largely again
apprehend, love, and practise this double polarity of their
lives? Only thus will the truest progress be possible in
the understanding, the application, and the fruitfulness of
Religion, with its great central origin and object, God, the
beginning and end of all our true progress, precisely
because He Himself already possesses immeasurably
more than all He helps us to become,&mdash;He Who, even
now already, is our Peace in Action, our Joy even in
the Cross.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h2>MORAL PROGRESS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">L. P. Jacks</span></h3>


<p>From the syllabus of all the lectures in this course
I gather that every lecturer on the programme is dealing
with the question of moral progress. This is inevitable.
Each lecturer must show that the particular sort of
progress he is dealing with is real or genuine progress, and
this it cannot be unless it is moral. That is itself a significant
fact and throws a valuable light on our subject. It
shows that progress, as it is studied throughout the course,
is not progress in the abstract, whatever that may mean,
but progress <i>for us</i> constituted as we are; and since our
constitution is essentially moral all progress that we can
recognize as such must be moral also. Science, Industry,
Government, might all claim progress on their own
ground and in their own nature, but this would not prove
progress as we understand the word, unless it could be
shown further that these things contribute to human
betterment in the highest sense of the word. <i>Their</i>
progress might conceivably involve <i>our</i> regress.</p>

<p>To believe in moral progress as an historical fact, as
a process that has begun, and is going on, and will be
continued&mdash;that is one thing, and it is my own position.
To believe that this progress is far advanced is another
thing, and is not my position. While believing in Moral
Progress as a fact, I also believe that we are much nearer
to the beginnings of it than the end. We should do well to
accustom ourselves to this thought. Many of our despairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
lamentations, and pessimisms are disappointments which
arise from our extravagant notions of the degree of
progress already attained. There has been a great deal
of what I have called philosophic pharisaism. Perhaps
it would be better called aeonic pharisaism. I mean the
spirit in the present age which seems to say 'I thank thee,
O God, that I am not as former ages: ignorant, barbaric,
cruel, unsocial; I read books, ride in aeroplanes, eat my
dinner with a knife and fork, and cheerfully pay my taxes
to the State; I study human science, talk freely about
humanity, and spend much of my time in making speeches
on social questions'. Now there is truth in all this, but
not the kind of truth which should lead us to self-flattery.
A good rule for optimists would be this: 'Believe in
moral progress, but do not believe in too much of it.'
I think there would be more optimists in the world, more
cheerfulness, more belief in moral progress, if we candidly
faced the fact that morally considered we are still in a neolithic
age, not brutes indeed any longer, and yet not so far
outgrown the brutish stage as to justify these trumpetings.
One of the beneficent lessons of the present war has been
to moderate our claims in this respect. It has revealed
us to ourselves as nothing else in history has ever done,
and it has revealed, among other things, that moral progress
is not nearly so advanced as we thought it was. It
has been a terrible blow to the pharisaism of which I have
just spoken. It has not discredited science, nor philosophy,
nor government, nor anything else that we value, but it
has shown that these things have not brought us as far
as we thought. That very knowledge, when you come to
think of it, is itself a very distinct step in moral progress.
Before the war we were growing morally conceited; we
thought ourselves much better, more advanced in morality,
than we really were, and this conceit was acting as a real
barrier to our farther advance. A sharp lesson was needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to take this conceit out of us&mdash;to remind us that as yet
we are only at the bare beginnings of moral advance&mdash;and
not, as some of us fondly imagined, next door to the goal.
This sudden awakening to the truth is full of promise for
the future.</p>

<p>And now what is the cause of these exaggerated notions
which so many of us have entertained? I think they
arise from our habit of letting ourselves be guided by
words rather than by realities, by what men are <i>saying</i>
rather than by what they are <i>doing</i>, by what teachers
are teaching than by what learners are learning. If you
take your stand in the realm of words, of doctrines, of
theories, of philosophies, of books, preachings, and
uttered ideals, you might make out a strong case for
a high degree of moral progress actually attained. But
if you ask how much of this has been learnt by mankind
at large, and learnt in such a way as to issue in practice,
you get a different story. We have attached too much
importance to the first story and too little to the second.
There has been a great deal of false emphasis in consequence.
This false emphasis is especially prominent in
the education controversy which is now going on&mdash;and
the question of moral progress, by the way, is the question
of education in the widest and highest sense of the term.
People seem quite content so long as they can get the
right thing taught. They don't always see that unless
the right thing is taught by the right people and in the
right way it will not be <i>learnt</i>. Now education is ultimately
a question of what is being <i>learnt</i>, not of what is
being <i>taught</i>. The process of learning is a very curious
and complicated one, and it often happens that what goes
in at the teacher's end comes out at the pupil's end in
a wholly different form and with a wholly different value;
and we have the highest authority for believing that what
really counts is not so much that which goeth into a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but that which cometh out of him. That applies to all
education&mdash;especially moral education. So that if you
argue from what has gone into the human race in the
way of moral teaching you may be greatly surprised and
perhaps disappointed when you compare it with what
has come out of the human race in the meantime. What
has been taught is not what has been learnt. It has
suffered a sea change in the process. Nor is the question
wholly one of learning. There is the further question of
remembering. I believe that a candid examination of the
facts would convince us that the human race has proved
itself a forgetful pupil. It has not always retained what
it has learnt. Emerson has said that no account of the
Holy Ghost has been lost. But how did Emerson find
that out? The only accents Emerson knew of were those
which the world happened to have remembered. If any
had been lost in the meantime Emerson naturally would
not know of their existence. I have heard of a functionary,
whose precise office I am not able to define, called 'the
Lord's Remembrancer'. It would be a great help to
Moral Progress if we had in modern life a People's Remembrancer.
His place is occupied to some extent by the study
of history, and for that reason one could wish for the sake
of Moral Progress that the study of history were universal.
For my own part I seldom open a book of history without
recovering what for me is a lost account of the Holy Ghost.
Next to conceit I reckon forgetfulness as the greatest
enemy of Moral Progress. I suppose Rudyard Kipling
had something of this in mind when he wrote his poem&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lord God of Hosts be with us yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest we forget, lest we forget.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another cause of our over-estimate of Moral Progress
is that we have thought too much of the abstract State
and too little of the actual States now in being. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
devotion to 'the' State as an ideal has led us to overlook
the fact that many actual States represent a form of
morality so low that it is doubtful if it can be called
morality at all. In their relations <i>with one another</i> they
display qualities which would disgrace the brutes. And
the worst of it is that at times these States drag down to
their own low level the morality of the individuals belonging
to them. Thus at the present moment we see quite
decent Englishmen and quite decent Germans tearing
one another to pieces like mad dogs, a thing they would
never dream of doing as between man and man, and
which they do only because they are in the grip of forces
alien to their own nature. We have overestimated
Progress by thinking only of what is happening inside
each of the States. We have forgotten to consider the
bearing of the States to one another, which remains on
a level lower than that of individuals.</p>

<p>The impression has gone abroad that the nations of the
world need to take <i>only one step</i> from the position where
they now stand to accomplish the final unity of all mankind.
Taking any one of these nations&mdash;our own for
example&mdash;we can trace the steps by which the warring
elements within it have become reconciled, until finally
there has emerged that vast unitary corporation&mdash;the
British Empire. So with all the others. What more is
required therefore than one step further in the same
direction, to join up all the States into a single world State.
But I am bound to think we are too hasty in treating the
unity of mankind as needing only one step more. It is
not so easy as all that. When you study the process by
which unity has been brought about in the various
European communities you find that motives of conquest
and corresponding motives of defence have had a great
deal to do with it. Germany, for example, was built up
and now holds together as a fighting unit. Whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Germany and the other States would still maintain their
cohesion when they were no longer fighting units, and
when the motives of conquest and defence were no longer
in operation, is a question on which I should not like to
dogmatize either way. Certainly we have no right to
assume offhand that the unifying process which has given
the nations the mass cohesion and efficiency they require
for holding their own against enemy States would still
remain in full power when there were no longer any enemy
States to be considered.</p>

<p>But what do we mean by Progress?</p>

<p>Progress may be defined as that process by which
a thing advances from a less to a more complete state of
itself. Now whether this process is a desirable one or not
obviously depends on the nature of the thing which is
progressing. Take the largest and most inclusive of all
things&mdash;the whole world. And now suppose philosophy
to have proved that the world, the whole world, is
advancing from a less to a more complete state of itself&mdash;which
as a matter of fact is what the doctrine of evolution
claims to have proved. Ought I to rejoice in this discovery?
Will it give me satisfaction? That clearly
depends on the nature of the world. If I am antecedently
assured that the world is good, I shall naturally rejoice
on hearing that it is advancing from a less to a more
complete state of itself. But if the nature of the world is
evil, what reason can I possibly have for rejoicing in its
evolution? Assuming the world to be evil in its essential
nature, I for my part, if I were consulted in the matter,
would certainly give my vote against its being allowed
to advance from a less to a more complete state of itself.
The less such a world progresses the easier it will be for
moral beings to live in it. Our interest lies in its remaining
as undeveloped as possible.</p>

<p>Obvious as this seems there are some evolutionists who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
take a rather different view. They seem to think that any
sort of world, no matter what its nature might be, would
ultimately become a good world if it were allowed to
develop its nature far enough. It is just the fact of its
continually becoming more of itself that makes it good.
But this would compel us to abandon our definition that
progress is the advance of a thing from a less to a more
complete state of <i>itself</i>. For if itself were a bad self to
begin with all such advance of <i>itself</i> would only make it
worse. It is possible that an essentially bad man like
Iago might be converted into a good one, but not by
advancing from a less to a more complete state of <i>himself</i>
as he originally was&mdash;unless indeed we change the hypothesis
and suppose that he was not essentially bad to
begin with. So with the world at large. Our nature
being what it is, namely moral, we must first be convinced
that the world is in principle good before we can derive
the least satisfaction from knowing that it is advancing
from a less to a more complete state of <i>itself</i>. The alternative
doctrine makes a breach in the doctrine of progress
which is inconsistent with its original form. A thing
develops by retaining its essential nature&mdash;that is the
original form. But a bad world which develops into
a good one doesn't retain its essential nature. There
comes a point somewhere when the next step of progress
can be achieved only by the thing dropping its original
nature&mdash;a point at which the thing is no longer becoming
more of its former self, which was bad, but is ceasing to
be its former self altogether and becoming something
else, which is good.</p>

<p>Let us apply this to progress in three specific directions&mdash;Science,
the Mechanical Arts, and Government.</p>

<p>We find that the progress of science has enormously
increased man's power over the forces of nature. Is it
a good thing that man's power over the forces of nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
should be increased? That surely depends on the
manner in which this power is used, and this depends
again on the moral nature of man. When we observe,
as we may truly observe, especially at the present time,
that of all the single applications which man has made
of science, the most extensive and perhaps the most
efficient is that of devising implements for destroying
his brother man, it is at least permissible to raise the
question whether the progress of science has contributed
on the whole to the progress of humanity. Had it not
been for the progress of science, which has enormously
increased the wealth of the world, it is doubtful if this
war, which is mainly a war about wealth, would have
taken place at all. Or if a war had broken out, it would
not have involved the appalling destruction of human life
and property we are now witnessing&mdash;such that, within
a space of two years, about six million human beings have
been killed, thirty-five millions wounded, and wealth
destroyed to the extent of about fifteen thousand millions
sterling&mdash;though some say it is very much more. Science
taught us to make this wealth: science has also taught
us how to destroy it. When one thinks of how much of
this is attributable to the progress of science, I say it is
<i>permissible to raise the question</i> whether man is a being
who can safely be entrusted with that control over the
forces of nature which science gives him. What if he uses
this power, as he plainly can do, for his own undoing? To
ask this, as we can hardly help asking, is to transfer the
question of scientific progress into the sphere of morality.
It is conceivable that the progress of science might
involve for us no progress at all. It might be, and some
have feared that it may become, a step towards the self-destruction
of the human race.</p>

<p>Take the mechanical arts. The chief effects of progress
in the mechanical arts have been an enormous increase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in the material wealth of mankind, and, partly consequent
upon this, a parallel growth of population in the industrial
countries of the world. It is by no means clear that
either of these things constitutes a definite step in
human progress. Consider the growth of population&mdash;the
immense increase in the total bulk and volume of the
human race. Whether this constitutes a clear gain to
humanity obviously cannot be answered without reference
to moral considerations. To increase the arithmetical
quantity of life in the world can be counted a gain only
if the general tendencies of life are in the right direction.
If they are in the wrong direction, then the more lives there
are to yield to these tendencies the less reason has the
moralist to be satisfied with what is happening. No one,
so far as I know, has ever seriously maintained that the
end and aim of progress is to increase the number of
human beings up to the limit which the planet is able
to support; though some doctrines if pressed to their
conclusion would lead to that, notably the doctrine that
all morality rests ultimately on the instinct for the
preservation and the reproduction of life. We have first
to be convinced that the human race is not on the wrong
road before we can look with complacency on the increase
of its numbers. We may note in this connexion that
mankind possesses no sort of collective control over its
own mass or volume. The mass or total number of lives
involved is determined by forces which are not subject
to the unitary direction of any existing human will either
individual or collective. This applies not only to the
human race as a whole, but to particular communities.
Their growth is unregulated. They just come to be what
they are in point of size. This fact seems to me a very
important one to bear in mind when we talk of the
progress of science giving us control over the forces of
nature. So far no state, no government, no community<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
has won any effective control over that group of the
forces of nature which determine the total size of the
community in question. It is an aspect of human destiny
which appears to be left to chance; and yet when we
consider what it means, is there any aspect of human
destiny on which such tremendous consequences depend?
And ought we not to consider this before claiming, as we
so often claim, that the progress of science has given us
control of the forces of nature? It is strange that this
point has not been more considered, especially by thinkers
who are fond of the word 'humanity'&mdash;'the good of
humanity'&mdash;or the 'greatest happiness of the greatest
number'. Humanity has an arithmetical or quantitative
side, and the good of humanity surely depends, to some
extent, on how much humanity there is. I can imagine
many things which might be good for a Greek city state
of 10,000 souls which would not be good, or not good in
the same sense, for a community of 100,000,000 souls.
Surely it needs no reasoning to prove that our power to
do our duty to others is affected by the number of others
to whom duty has to be done&mdash;it makes a difference where
there are 10,000 of men or 100,000,000. Similarly with
the greatest happiness of the greatest number. What is
the <i>greatest</i> number? A great deal that has been said
about this would not have been said if we had considered
that the <i>greatest number</i> itself is left at the disposal of
forces outside the present scope of our own will. Even
the proposal to sell our goods and give the proceeds to
the poor would surely be affected, from the moral point
of view, by the number of the poor who were to receive
the distribution. Were this so small that the poor would
get five pounds apiece it would be one question; were it
so large that they would receive a halfpenny apiece it
would be another question. Thus we may conclude that
the progress of the mechanical arts with the consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
increase in the bulk of the human race has not solved the
problem of moral progress, but only placed that problem
in a new and more perplexing context. A similar conclusion
would meet us if we were to consider the parallel
increase of the wealth of the world. The moral question
is not about the amount of wealth the world possesses,
but about the way men spend it and the use they make
of it. Industrially speaking, the human race has made
its fortune during the last hundred years. But has it
made up its mind what to do with the fortune? And has
its mind been made up in the right way? To raise these
questions is to see that progress from the economic point
of view may be the reverse of progress from the moral.
But I shall not further enlarge upon this&mdash;the theme
being too familiar.</p>

<p>The third question which relates itself to moral progress
is that of Government. Now Government, I need hardly
say, is not an end in itself. It is a device which man has
set up to help him in attaining the true end of his life.
To make up our minds how we ought to be governed is
therefore impossible unless we have previously made up
our minds how we ought to live. What might be a good
government for a people whose end is industrial success
might be a very bad one for a people who had some other
end in view. Well, then, are we well governed at the
present time? Are we better governed than we were?
Has progress taken place in this department? Plainly
we cannot answer these questions unless we have chosen
our end in life and are morally satisfied with it. In the
history of modern states we discover a tendency, more
strongly marked in some quarters than in others, towards
that form of democracy which is called responsible self-government.
Government of the people, for the people,
by the people. The people are going to govern themselves.
But they may do so in a thousand different <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>ways&mdash;each
of which has a different moral value. A people may
go wrong just as fatally in governing itself as in being
governed by some external authority. I confess that
nothing I can learn from the history of government
entirely reassures me on this point. I see everywhere
progress towards organization, but then one is bound to
ask on what ulterior end is this organization directed?
I see everywhere a growing subordination of the individual
to the State. This may or may not be a very good thing.
What <i>kind of State</i> is it to which the individual is becoming
subordinated? There are great differences among them&mdash;some
seem to me, one in particular at the present time,
thoroughly bad, and I cannot see that the individual
gains morally by being subordinated to such a State&mdash;at
least if he gains in one direction he loses more in
another.</p>

<p>Even the social unity which Governments are capable
of achieving must not be too hastily translated into moral
progress. We are entitled to ask several questions before
the one can be equated with the other. To begin with,
do men know what they want to achieve by their unified
life? And if they do know what they want, have we not
still the right to criticize its moral value and say 'this is
right' or this is wrong? Should the time ever come when
the common will of mankind should get itself expressed
by the decrees of a universal democracy, would moral
criticism be at an end so far as the said decrees were
concerned? For my part I cannot see that it would.
Perhaps it were truer to say that only then would moral
criticism effectively begin. As things now are, we are
prevented from criticizing the common will because none
of us knows what exactly the common will demands. But
if it could get itself expressed and defined by the decrees
of a perfect democracy we should know. Those decrees
would reveal the human community to itself, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
possible that the revelation would not be altogether
agreeable to our moral sense. We might then discover
that the common will is capable of being grossly immoral.
So far it has been impossible for us to make this discovery
because no organ exists for expressing the common will
on the human scale, and even those which express it on
the national scale are not perfect. I am far from saying
the discovery would be made; but I know of no line of
argument which rules it out as impossible. Meanwhile
we are scarcely justified in regarding the common will as
necessarily moral until we know more than we do of what
precisely it is that the common will aims at and intends
to achieve. To back the common will through thick and
thin, as some of our philosophers seem disposed to do, is
a dangerous speculation&mdash;it might perhaps be described
as putting your money on a dark horse.</p>

<p>This leads me to say a word concerning a phrase which
has been much in use of late&mdash;the Collective Wisdom of
Mankind, or the Collective Wisdom of the State. Progress
is sometimes defined as a gradual approach to a state of
things where this collective wisdom rules the course of
events. And collective wisdom is sometimes represented
as vastly wiser than that possessed by any individual,
even the wisest.</p>

<p>Now if this really is so it seems pretty obvious that,
when the collective wisdom speaks, no individual can have
the right of appeal. What are you, what am I, that either
of us should set up our private intelligence against the
intelligence of forty million of our fellow citizens? That
surely would be a preposterous claim. The collective
wisdom must know best: at least it knows much better
than you or I.</p>

<p>But is the collective wisdom of the State so immensely
superior to that of the individual, and of necessity so?
Have we any means of bringing the matter to the test?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
It is extremely difficult to do so. Not until we make the
experiment do we find how rare are the occasions of which
we can say that then and there the collective wisdom of
the community fairly and fully expressed itself. Acts of
Parliament are not good examples. They usually represent
not the collective wisdom of the whole community,
but the wisdom of the majority after it has been checked,
modified, and perhaps nullified by the opposing wisdom
of an almost equal minority. Take as an example the
history of the Irish Question. How difficult it is to put
one's finger on any moment in that tangled story and
say that then and there the collective wisdom of the community
knew what it wanted to do and did it! So with
almost everything else.</p>

<p>Now if there be such a thing as the collective wisdom
of the State I suppose that the moment when we are most
likely to find it in action is the moment when one State
has dealings with another State. That surely is a fair test.
If States possess collective wisdom they ought to show
its existence and measure when they confront one
another <i>as States</i>&mdash;when State calls to State across the
great deeps of international policy. What should we say
of any State which claimed collective wisdom only when
dealing with its own individual members&mdash;with you and
me&mdash;but dropped the claim when the question was one
of reasonable intercourse with another State similarly
endowed? This we should say is a very dubious claim.</p>

<p>Well, how stands the matter when this test is applied?
The present war provides the answer. The war arose out
of a type of quarrel which, had it occurred between half
a dozen individuals of average intelligence, would have
been amicably settled, by reasonable human intercourse,
in twenty minutes. Does not this afford a rough measure
of the collective wisdom of such States as at present exist
in this world? Does it not suggest that they have little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
faculty of reasonable intercourse with one another?
And when you say <i>that</i> of any being, or any collection of
beings, do you not put it pretty low down in the scale of
intelligence? It is literally true that these States do not
understand one another. Thus we are driven back upon
a plain alternative; either the States do not represent
collective wisdom, or else this collective wisdom is one
of the lowest forms of wisdom now extant on this planet.
In either case we must be very cautious in our use of the
phrase. We must not infer moral progress from the reign
of collective wisdom until we are assured that collective
wisdom is really as wise as some of its devotees assume it
to be.</p>

<p>About the idea of moral progress, which is only another
name for the idea of progress in its widest form, I need
say little, the question having been adequately treated
by other lecturers. But I will add this. Belief in moral
progress is a belief which no man can live without, and,
at the same time, a belief which cannot be proved by any
appeal to human experience. We cannot live without
it, because life is just the process of reaching forward to
a better form of itself. Were a man to say that since
the world began no moral progress has taken place he
would thereby show his latent belief in moral progress.
For no man would take the trouble to deny moral progress
unless he believed that the world would in some
way be made better by his denial. He would not even
trouble to come to a private conclusion in the matter
unless he believed that his private conclusion was something
to the good. In that sense perhaps we may say
that moral progress is proved, for the best proof of any
belief is that it remains indispensable to the life we have
to live. But the appeal to experience would not prove
it&mdash;and for this reason. A progressive world is a world
which not only makes gains, but <i>keeps</i> its gains when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are made. If the Kingdom of Heaven were to become
a fact to-morrow, that of itself would not prove progress,
if you admit the possibility that the world might hereafter
retreat from the position it had won. That possibility
you could never rule out&mdash;except by an appeal to faith.
A world which attained the goal and then lost it would
be a greater failure, from the point of view of moral
progress, than one which never attained the goal at all.
The doctrine that the gains of morality can never be lost
is widely held; but it does not rest on a philosophic or
a scientific basis. As Hume taught long ago, you cannot
infer an infinite conclusion from finite data&mdash;and in this
case the conclusion is infinite and the data are finite.
They are not only finite but various: some pointing one
way, some another.</p>

<p>Finally we cannot prove moral progress by appeal to
any objective standard, such as the amount of happiness
existing in the world at successive dates. Suppose you
were able to show that, up to date, the amount of happiness
in the world has shown a steady increase until it has
reached the grand sum total now existing. Now suppose
that you were transferred to another planet where the
conditions were the exact opposite: where the inhabitants
ages ago started with the happiness we now possess,
and gradually declined until, at the present moment, they
are no happier than the human race was at the first stage
of its career. Now add together the totals of happiness
for both your worlds, the ascending world which starts
with the minimum and ends with the maximum, the
declining world which starts with the maximum and ends
with the minimum. The grand totals in both cases are
exactly the same. So far as the total result is concerned,
the declining world has just as much to show for itself
as the ascending. Valued in terms of happiness, the one
world would be worth as much as the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet we know that the value of these two worlds is
not the same. The ascending is worth a lot more than
the descending. Why? I leave you with that conundrum.
Answer it, and you have the key to the meaning of Moral
Progress.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN GOVERNMENT</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A. E. Zimmern</span></h3>


<p>When I was asked to speak to you on the subject of
Progress in Government I gladly accepted, for it is a subject
on which I have reflected a good deal. But when I
came to think over what I should say, I saw that you had
asked me for the impossible. For what is Government?
I do not know whether there are any here for whom
Government means no more than a policeman, or a ballot-box,
or a list of office-holders. The days of such shallow
views are surely over. Government is the work of ordering
the external affairs and relationships of men. It covers
all the activities of men as members of a community&mdash;social,
industrial, and religious as well as political in the
narrower sense. It is concerned, as the ancients had it,
with 'that which is public or common', what the Greeks
called <span class='correction' title='to koinon'>&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#957;</span> and the Romans <i>res publica</i>. The
Old English translation of these classical terms is 'The
Commonwealth' or Common Weal; and I do not see
that we can do better than adopt that word, with its
richness of traditional meaning and its happy association
of the two conceptions, too often separated in modern
minds, of Wealth and Welfare.</p>

<p>Our subject then is the Progress of the Commonwealth
or, in other words, the record of the course of the common
life of mankind in the world. It is a theme which really
underlies all the other subjects of discussion at this week's
meetings: for it is only the existence of the Commonwealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and its organized efforts to preserve and sustain the life
of the individuals composing it, which have made possible
the achievements of mankind in the various separate
fields of effort which are claiming your attention. Lord
Acton spent a lifetime collecting material for a History
of Liberty. He never wrote it: but, if he had, it would
have been a History of Mankind. A History of Government
or of the Commonwealth would be nothing less.
Such is the nature of the invitation so kindly given to me
and so cheerfully accepted. If you could wait a lifetime
for the proper treatment of the subject I would gladly give
the time; for, in truth, it is worth it.</p>

<p>What is the nature of this common life of mankind and
with what is it concerned? The subjects of its concern
are as wide as human nature itself. We cannot define them
in a formula: for human nature overleaps all formulas.
Whenever men have tried to rule regions of human activity
and aspiration out of the common life of mankind, and to
hedge them round as private or separate or sacred or by
any other kind of taboo, human nature has always ended
by breaking through the hedges and invading the retreat.
Man is a social animal. If he retires to a monastery he
finds he has carried problems of organization with him,
as the promoters of this gathering would confess you have
brought with you here. If he shuts himself up in his
home as a castle, or in a workshop or factory as the domain
of his own private power, social problems go with him
thither, and the long arm of the law will follow after.
If he crosses the seas like the Pilgrim Fathers, to worship
God unmolested in a new country, or, like the merchant-venturers,
to fetch home treasure from the Indies, he will
find himself unwittingly the pioneer of civilization and
the founder of an Empire or a Republic. In the life of
our fellows, in the Common Weal, we live and move and
have our being. Let us recall some wise words on this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
subject from the Master of Balliol's book on the Middle
Ages. 'The words "Church" and "State"', he writes,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>represent what ought to be an alliance, but is, in modern
times, at best a dualism and often an open warfare....
The opposition of Church and State expresses an opposition
between two sides of human nature which we must
not too easily label as good and evil, the heavenly and
the earthly, the sacred and the profane. For the State,
too, is divine as well as the Church, and may have its own
ideals and sacramental duties and its own prophets, even
its own martyrs. The opposition of Church and State is
to be regarded rather as the pursuit of one great aim,
pursued by contrasted means. The ultimate aim of all
true human activity must be in the noble words of
Francis Bacon 'the glory of God and the relief of man's
estate'.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>Bacon's words form a fitting starting-point for our
reflections: for they bring vividly before us both the
idealism which should inspire all who labour at the task
of government and the vastness and variety of the field
with which they are concerned. Looked at in this broad
light, the history of man's common life in the world
will, I think, show two great streams of progress&mdash;the
progress of man over Nature, or, as we say to-day, in the
control of his environment, and the progress of man in what
is essentially a moral task&mdash;the art of living together with
his fellows. These two aspects of human activity and effort
are in constant contact and interaction. Studied together,
they reveal an advance which, in spite of man's ever-present
moral weakness, may be described as an advance
from Chaos to Cosmos in the organization of the world's
common life; yet they are so distinct in method and spirit
that they can best be described separately.</p>

<p>Let us first, then, consider the history of Government,
as a record of the progress of man's power over Nature.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>Human history, in this sphere, is the story of man making
himself at home in the world. When human history
begins we find men helpless, superstitious, ignorant, the
plaything of blind powers in the natural and animal
world. Superstitious because he was helpless, helpless
because he was ignorant, he eked out a bare existence
rather by avoiding than controlling the forces in the
little world by which he found himself surrounded.
Human life in its earliest stages is, as Hobbes described
it, nasty, brutish, and short. Man was the slave of his
environment. He has risen to become its master. The
world, as the prophetic eye of Francis Bacon foretold,
has become 'The Kingdom of Man'.</p>

<p>How complete this conquest is, can best be realized
perhaps by considering man's relation to the lower animals.
When history opens, the animals are in their element;
it is man who is the interloper. Two thousand years ago
it was not the Society of Friends but wolves and wild
boars who felt themselves at home on the site of Bournville
Garden Village. To-day we are surprised when we read
that in remote East Africa lions and giraffes venture
occasionally to interfere in the murderous warfare between
man and man. Man has imposed himself on the animals,
by dint of his gradual accumulation of knowledge and his
consequent power of organization and government. He
has destroyed the conditions under which the animals
prospered. He has, as we might say, destroyed their
home life, exposing them to dangers of his own making
against which they are now as powerless as he was once
against them. 'It is a remarkable thing,' writes Sir E.
Ray Lankester,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>which possibly may be less generally true than our
present knowledge seems to suggest&mdash;that the adjustment
of organisms to their surroundings is so severely complete
in Nature apart from Man, that diseases are unknown as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
constant and normal phenomena under those conditions.
It is no doubt difficult to investigate this matter, since
the presence of Man as an observer itself implies human
intervention. But it seems to be a legitimate view that
every disease to which animals (and probably plants
also) are liable, excepting as a transient and very exceptional
occurrence, is due to Man's interference. The
diseases of cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses are not known
except in domesticated herds and those wild creatures
to which Man's domesticated productions have communicated
them. The trypanosome lives in the blood of wild
game and of rats without producing mischief. The hosts
have become tolerant of the parasite. It is only when
man brings his unselected, humanly-nurtured races of
cattle and horses into contact with the parasite, that it
is found to have deadly properties. The various cattle-diseases
which in Africa have done so much harm to
native cattle, and have in some regions exterminated
big game, have <i>per contra</i> been introduced by man
through his importation of diseased animals of his own
breeding from Europe. Most, if not all, animals in extra-human
conditions, including the minuter things such as
insects, shellfish, and invisible aquatic organisms, have
been brought into a condition of 'adjustment' to their
parasites as well as to the other conditions in which they
live: it is this most difficult and efficient balance of
Nature which Man everywhere upsets.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>And Sir E. Ray Lankester goes on to point out the
moral to be drawn from this development. He points
out that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>civilized man has proceeded so far in his interference
with extra-human nature, has produced for himself and
the living organisms associated with him such a special
state of things by his rebellion against natural selection
and his defiance of Nature's pre-human dispositions, that
he must either go on and acquire firmer control of the
conditions, or perish miserably by the vengeance certain
to fall on the half-hearted meddler in great affairs. We
may indeed compare civilized man to a successful rebel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
against Nature, who, by every step forward, renders
himself liable to greater and greater penalties, and so
cannot afford to pause or fail in one single step. Or again
we may think of him as the heir to a vast and magnificent
kingdom, who has been finally educated so as to take
possession of his property, and is at length left alone to
do his best; he has wilfully abrogated, in many important
respects, the laws of his mother Nature by which the
kingdom was hitherto governed; he has gained some
power and advantage by so doing, but is threatened on
every hand by dangers and disasters hitherto restrained:
no retreat is possible&mdash;his only hope is to control, as he
knows that he can, the sources of these dangers and
disasters.</p></div>

<p>The time will come, not too long hence, as I believe,
when men have realized, with the scientists, that the
world is one kingdom not many, and these problems of
man's relation to his non-human environment will be
the first concern of statesmen and governors. In some of
our tropical colonies they have, perforce, become so
already. If you live on the Gold Coast, the war against
malaria cannot help seeming more important to you than
the war against German trade: and in parts of Central
Africa the whole possibility of continued existence centres
round the presence or absence of the tsetse fly which is the
carrier of sleeping sickness. Some day, when means have
been adopted for abating our fiercer international controversies,
we shall discover that in these and kindred
matters lies the real province of world-politics. When
that day comes the chosen representatives of the human
race will see their constituents, as only philosophers see
them now, as the inheritors of a great tradition of service
and achievement, and as trustees for their successors of
the manifold sources of human happiness which the
advance of knowledge has laid open to us.</p>

<p>If the first and most important of these sources is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
discovery of the conditions of physical well-being, the
second is the discovery of means of communication between
the widely separate portions of man's kingdom. The
record of the process of bringing the world under the
control of the organized government of man is largely
the record of the improvement of communications. Side
by side with the unending struggle of human reason
against cold and hunger and disease we can watch the
contest against distance, against ocean and mountain and
desert, against storms and seasons. There can be few
subjects more fascinating for a historian to study than the
record of the migrations of the tribes of men. He might
begin, if he wished, with the migrations of animals and
describe the westward progress of the many species whose
course can be traced by experts along the natural highways
of Western Europe. Some of them, so the books tell us,
reached the end of their journey while Britain was still
joined to the continent. Others arrived too late and
were cut off by the straits of Dover. I like to form an
imaginary picture, which the austerity of the scientific
conscience will, I know, repudiate with horror, of the
unhappy congregation, mournfully assembled bag and
baggage on the edge of the straits and gazing wistfully
across at the white cliffs of England, which they were not
privileged to reach&mdash;<i>tendentesque manus ripae ulterioris
amore</i>, 'stretching out their paws in longing for the
further bank.'</p>

<p>Our historian would then go on to describe the early
'wanderings of peoples' (<i>V&ouml;lkerwanderungen</i>) how whole
tribes would move off in the spring-time in the search for
fresh hunting-grounds or pasture. He would trace the
course of that westward push which, starting from
somewhere in Asia, brought its impact to bear on the
northern provinces of the Roman Empire and eventually
loosened its whole fabric. He would show how Europe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
as we know it, was welded into unity by the attacks of
migratory warriors on three flanks&mdash;the Huns and the
Tartars, a host of horsemen riding light over the steppes
of Russia and Hungary: the Arabs, bearing Islam with
them on their camels as they moved westward along
North Africa and then pushing across into Spain: and
the Northmen of Scandinavia, those carvers of kingdoms
and earliest conquerors of the open sea, who left their
mark on England and northern France, on Sicily and
southern Italy, on the Balkan Peninsula, on Russia,
on Greenland, and as far as North America. Then,
passing to Africa and Asia, he would describe the life of
the pack-saddle and the caravan, the long and mysterious
inland routes from the Mediterranean to Nubia and
Nigeria, or from Damascus with the pilgrims to Medina,
and the still longer and more mysterious passage through
the ancient oases of Turkestan, now buried in sand, along
which, as recent discoveries have shown us, Greece and
China, Christianity and Buddhism, exchanged their arts
and ideas and products. Then he would tell of the great
age of maritime discovery, of the merchant-adventurers
and buccaneers, of their gradual transformation into
trading companies, in the East and in the West, from
companies to settlements, from settlements to colonies.
Then perhaps he would close by casting a glimpse at the
latest human migration of all, that which takes place or
took place up to 1914, at the rate of a million a year from
the Old World into the United States. He would take
the reader to Ellis Island in New York harbour, where the
immigrants emerge from the steerage to face the ordeal of
the Immigration Officer. He would show how the same
causes, hunger, fear, persecution, restlessness, ambition,
love of liberty, which set the great westward procession
in motion in the early days of tribal migration, are still
alive and at work to-day among the populations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Eastern Europe. He would look into their minds and read
the story of the generations of their nameless fore-runners;
and he would ask himself whether rulers and statesmen
have done all that they might to make the world a home
for all its children, for the poor as for the rich, for the Jew
as for the Gentile, for the yellow and dark-skinned as
for the white.</p>

<p>Let us dwell for a moment more closely on one phase
of this record of the conquest of distance. The crucial
feature in that struggle was the conquest of the sea. The
sea-surface of the world is far greater than its land-surface,
and the sea, once subdued, is a far easier and more natural
means of transport and communication. For the sea, the
uncultivable sea, as Homer calls it, is itself a road,
whereas on earth, whether it be mountain or desert
or field, roads have first painfully to be made. Man's
definitive conquest of the sea dates from the middle of
the fifteenth century when, by improvements in the art
of sailing and by the extended use of the mariner's
compass, it first became possible to undertake long voyages
with assurance. These discoveries are associated with
the name of Prince Henry of Portugal, whose life-long
ambition it was, to quote the words engraved on his
monument at the southern extremity of Portugal,
'to lay open the regions of West Africa across the sea,
hitherto not traversed by man, that thence a passage
might be made round Africa to the most distant parts
of the East.'</p>

<p>The opening of the high seas which resulted from
Prince Henry's activities is one of the most momentous
events in human history. Its effect was, sooner or later,
to unite the scattered families of mankind, to make the
problems of all the concern of all: to make the world one
place. Prince Henry and his sailors were, in fact, the
pioneers of internationalism, with all the many and varied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
problems that internationalism brings with it. 'In 1486,'
says the most recent history of this development,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bartholomew Dias was carried by storm beyond the sight
of land, round the southern point of Africa, and reached
the Great Fish River, north of Algoa Bay. On his return
journey he saw the promontory which divides the oceans,
as the narrow waters of the Bosphorus divide the continents,
of the East and West. As in the crowded streets
of Constantinople, so here, if anywhere, at this awful
and solitary headland the elements of two hemispheres
meet and contend. As Dias saw it, so he named it, 'The
Cape of Storms'. But his master, John II, seeing in the
discovery a promise that India, the goal of the national
ambition, would be reached, named it with happier
augury 'The Cape of Good Hope'. No fitter name could
have been given to that turning-point in the history of
mankind. Europe, in truth, was on the brink of achievements
destined to breach barriers, which had enclosed
and diversified the nations since the making of the World,
and commit them to an intercourse never to be broken
again so long as the World endures. That good rather
than evil may spring therefrom is the greatest of all
human responsibilities.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></div>

<p>The contrast between Constantinople and the Cape,
so finely drawn in these lines, marks the end of the age
when land-communications and land-power were predominant
over sea-power. The Roman Empire was, and
could only be, a land-power. It is no accident that the
British Commonwealth is, as the American Commonwealth
is fast becoming, predominantly a sea-power.</p>

<p>How was 'the greatest of all human responsibilities',
arising from this new intercourse of races, met? Knowledge,
alas, is as much the devil's heritage as the angels': it
may be used for ill, as easily as for good. The first
explorers, and the traders who followed them, were not
idealists but rough adventurers. Breaking in, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
full tide of western knowledge and adaptability, to the
quiet backwaters of primitive conservatism, they brought
with them the worse rather than the better elements
of the civilization, the control of environment, of which
they were pioneers. To them Africa and the East represented
storehouses of treasure, not societies of men;
and they treated the helpless natives accordingly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>England and Holland as well as the Latin monarchies
treated the natives of Africa as chattels without rights
and as instruments for their own ends, and revived
slavery in a form and upon a scale more cruel than any
practised by the ancients. The employment of slaves on
her own soil has worked the permanent ruin of Portugal.
The slave trade with America was an important source
of English wealth, and the philosopher John Locke did
not scruple to invest in it. There is no European race
which can afford to remember its first contact with the
subject peoples otherwise than with shame, and attempts
to assess their relative degrees of guilt are as fruitless as
they are invidious. The question of real importance is
how far these various states were able to purge themselves
of the poison, and rise to a higher realization of their duty
towards their races whom they were called by the claims
of their own superior civilization to protect. The fate of
that civilization itself hung upon the issue.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p></div>

<p>The process by which the Western peoples have risen
to a sense of their duty towards their weaker and more
ignorant fellow citizens is indeed one of the chief stages
in that progress of the common life of mankind with which
we are concerned.</p>

<p>How is that duty to be exercised? The best way in
which the strong can help the weak is by making them
strong enough to help themselves. The white races are not
strong because they are white, or virtuous because they
are strong. They are strong because they have acquired,
through a long course of thought and work, a mastery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
over Nature and hence over their weaker fellow men. It
is not virtue but knowledge to which they owe their
strength. No doubt much virtue has gone to the making
of that knowledge&mdash;virtues of patience, concentration,
perseverance, unselfishness, without which the great
body of knowledge of which we are the inheritors could
never have been built up. But we late-born heirs of the
ages have it in our power to take the knowledge of our
fathers and cast away any goodness that went to its
making. We have come into our fortune: it is ours to
use it as we think best. We cannot pass it on wholesale,
and at one step, to the more ignorant races, for they
have not the institutions, the traditions, the habits of
mind and character, to enable them to use it. Those
too we must transmit or develop together with the treasure
of our knowledge. For the moment we stand in the
relation of trustees, teachers, guides, governors, but always
in their own interest and not ours, or rather, in the
interest of the commonwealth of which we and they,
since the opening of the high seas, form an inseparable
part.</p>

<p>It has often been thought that the relation of the advanced
and backward races should be one purely of
philanthropy and missionary enterprise rather than of
law and government. It is easy to criticize this by
pointing to the facts of the world as we know it&mdash;to the
existing colonial empires of the Great Powers and to
the vast extension of the powers of civilized governments
which they represent. But it may still be argued that
the question is not Have the civilized powers annexed
large empires? but Ought they to have done so? Was
such an extension of governmental authority justifiable
or inevitable? Englishmen in the nineteenth century,
like Americans in the twentieth, were slow to admit
that it was; just as the exponents of <i>laissez-faire</i> were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
slow to admit the necessity for State interference with
private industry at home. But in both cases they have
been driven to accept it by the inexorable logic of facts.
What other solution of the problem, indeed, is possible?
'Every alternative solution', as a recent writer remarks,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>breaks down in practice. To stand aside and do nothing
under the plea that every people must be left free to
manage its own affairs, and that intervention is wicked,
is to repeat the tragic mistake of the Manchester School
in the economic world which protested against any
interference by the State to protect
workmen ... from the oppression and rapacity of employers, on
the ground that it was an unwarranted interference
with the liberty of the subject and the freedom of trade
and competition. To prevent adventurers from entering
the territory is impossible, unless there is some civilized
authority within it to stop them through its police. To
shut off a backward people from all contact with the
outside world by a kind of blockade is not only unpracticable,
but is artificially to deny them the chances of education
and progress. The establishment of a genuine
government by a people strong enough and liberal enough
to ensure freedom under the law and justice for all is the
only solution.... They must undertake this duty, not from
any pride of dominion, or because they wish to exploit
their resources, but in order to protect them alike from
oppression and corruption, by strict laws and strict
administration, which shall bind the foreigner as well as
the native, and then they must gradually develop, by
education and example, the capacity in the natives to
manage their own affairs.</p></div>

<p>Thus we see that the progress in knowledge and in
the control of their environment made by the civilized
peoples has, in fact and inevitably, led to their leadership
in government also, and given them the predominant
voice in laying down the lines along which the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
life of mankind is to develop. If we are to look for the
mainspring of the world's activities, for the place where
its new ideas are thought out, its policies framed, its
aspirations cast into practical shape, we must not seek
it in the forests of Africa or in the interior of China,
but in those busy regions of the earth's surface where the
knowledge, the industries, and all the various organizations
of government and control find their home. Because
organization is embodied knowledge, and because knowledge
is power, it is the Great Powers, as we truly name
them,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who are predominantly responsible for the government
of the world and for the future of the common life
of mankind.</p>

<p>In the exercise of this control the world has already,
in many respects, become a single organism. The conquest
of distance in the fifteenth century was the beginning
of a process which led, slowly but inevitably, to the
widening of the boundaries of government. Two discoveries
made about the same time accentuated the same
tendency. By the invention of gunpowder the people of
Europe were given an overwhelming military superiority
over the dwellers in other continents. By the invention
of printing, knowledge was internationalized for all who
had the training to use it. Books are the tools of the brain-worker
all the world over; but, unlike the file and the
chisel, the needle and the hammer, books not only create,
but suggest. A new idea is like an electric current set
running throughout the world, and no man can say into
what channels of activity it may not be directed.</p>

<p>But neither travel nor conquest nor books and the
spread of ideas caused so immense a transformation in the
common life of mankind as the process beginning at the end
of the eighteenth century which is known to historians as
the Industrial Revolution. As we have spoken of the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>quest
of distance perhaps a better name for the Industrial
Revolution would be the Conquest of Organization. For it
was not the discovery of the steam-engine or the spinning-jenny
which constituted the revolution: it was the fact
that men were now in a position to apply these discoveries
to the organization of industry. The ancient Greeks played
with the idea of the steam-engine: it was reserved for
eighteenth-century England to produce a generation of
pioneers endowed with the knowledge, the power, the
foresight, and the imagination to make use of the world-transforming
potentialities of the idea. The Industrial
Revolution, with its railways and steamships, telegraphs
and telephones, and now its airships and submarines
and wireless communication, completed the conquest
of distance. Production became increasingly organized
on international lines. Men became familiar with the
idea of an international market. Prices and prospects,
booms and depressions, banking and borrowing, became
international phenomena. The organization of production
led to an immensely rapid increase of wealth in
Western Europe. The application of that wealth to the
development of the world's resources in and outside
Europe led to a correspondingly huge advance in trade
and intercourse. The breakfast-table in an ordinary
English home to-day is a monument to the achievements
of the Industrial Revolution and to the solid reality of
the economic internationalism which resulted from it.
There is still poverty in Western Europe, but it is
preventable poverty. Before the Industrial Revolution,
judged by a modern standard, there was nothing but
poverty. The satisfying physical and economic condition
which we describe by the name of comfort did not
exist. The Italian historian Ferrero, in one of his essays,
recommends those who have romantic yearnings after the
good old times to spend one night on what our forefathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
called a bed. Mr. Coulton, in his books on the Middle
Ages, has used some very plain language on the same text.
And Professor Smart, in his recently published posthumous
work, pointing a gentle finger of rebuke at certain
common Socialist fantasies, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There never was a golden age of equality of wealth:
there was rather a leaden one of inequality of poverty....
We should speak more guardedly of the riches of the
old world. A careful examination of any old book would
show that the most splendid processions of pomp and
luxury in the Middle Ages were poor things compared
to the parade of a modern circus on its opening day.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p></div>

<p>Such prosperity as we enjoy to-day, such a scene as
we can observe on these smiling outskirts of Birmingham,
is due to man's Conquest of Organization and to
the consequent development and linking-up, by mutual
intercourse and exchange, of the economic side of the
world's life.</p>

<p>So far we have been watching the progress of man in
his efforts to 'make himself at home' in the world. We
have seen him becoming more skilful and more masterful
century by century, till in these latter days the whole
world is, as it were, at his service. He has planted his
flag at the two poles: he has cut a pathway for his ships
between Asia and Africa, and between the twin continents
of America: he has harnessed torrents and cataracts
to his service: he has conquered the air and the depths
of the sea: he has tamed the animals: he has rooted
out pestilence and laid bare its hidden causes: and he is
penetrating farther and ever farther in the discovery of
the causes of physical and mental disease. He has set
his foot on the neck of Nature. But the last and greatest
conquest is yet before him. He has yet to conquer
himself. Victorious against Nature, men are still at war,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
nay, more than ever at war, amongst themselves. How is
it that the last century and a half, which have witnessed
so unparalleled an advance in the organization of the
common life of man on the material side, should have been
an age of wars and rumours of wars, culminating in the
vastest and most destructive conflict that this globe of
ours has ever witnessed? What explanation could we
give of this to a visitor from the moon or to those creatures
of inferior species whom, as Sir E. Ray Lankester has told
us, it is our function, thanks to our natural superiority,
to command and control?</p>

<p>This brings us to the second great branch of our subject&mdash;the
progress of mankind in the art of living together
in the world.</p>

<p>Government, as we have seen, covers the whole social
life of man: for the principles that regulate human
association are inherent in the nature of man. But in
what follows we shall perforce confine ourselves mainly
to the sphere of what is ordinarily called politics, that is
to the recognized and authoritative form of human
association called the State, as opposed to the innumerable
subordinate or voluntary bodies and relationships, which
pervade every department of man's common life.</p>

<p>The progress of Government in this second sphere may
be defined as the deepening and extension of man's duty
towards his neighbour. It is to be reckoned, not in terms
of knowledge and organization, but of character. The
ultimate goal of human government, in the narrower
sense, as of all social activity&mdash;let us never forget it&mdash;is
liberty, to set free the life of the spirit. 'Liberty,' said
Lord Acton, who could survey the ages with a wealth
of knowledge to which no other man, perhaps, ever
attained, 'Liberty is not a means to a higher political
end. It is itself the highest political end. It is not for
the sake of a good public administration that it is required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but for security in the pursuit of the highest objects of
civil society and of private life.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Government is needed
in order to enable human life to become, not efficient or
well-informed or well-ordered, but simply good; and Lord
Acton believed, as the Greeks and generations of Englishmen
believed before him, that it is only in the soil of
liberty that the human spirit can grow to its full stature,
and that a political system based upon any other principle
than that of responsible self-government acts as a bar at
the outset to the pursuit of what he called 'the highest
objects of civil society or of private life'. For though
a slave, or a man living under a servile political system,
may develop many fine qualities of character: yet such
virtues will, in Milton's words, be but 'fugitive and
cloistered', 'unexercised and unbreathed'. For liberty,
and the responsibilities that it involves, are the school
of character and the appointed means by which men can
best serve their neighbours. A man deprived of such
opportunities, cut off from the quickening influence of
responsibility, has, as Homer said long ago 'lost half
his manhood'. He may be a loyal subject, a brave
soldier, a diligent and obedient workman: but he will
not be a full-grown man. Government will have starved
and stunted him in that which it is the supreme object
of government to develop and set free.</p>

<p>It is idle, then, to talk in general terms about the extension
of government as a good thing, whether in relation
to the individual citizen or to the organization of the
world into an international State. We have always first
to ask: What kind of Government? On what principles
will it be based? What ideal will it set forth? What
kind of common life will it provide or allow to its citizens?
If the whole world were organized into one single State,
and that State, supreme in its control over Nature, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
armed with all the knowledge and organization that the
ablest and most farseeing brains in the world could
supply, yet mankind might be worse off under its sway,
in the real essentials of human life, than if they were
painted savages. 'Though I have the gift of prophecy
and understand all mysteries and all knowledge: and
though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing.' Government may
be the organization of goodness, or the organization of
evil. It may provide the conditions by which the common
life of society can develop along the lines of man's spiritual
nature: or it may take away the very possibility of such
a development. Till we know what a Government stands
for, do not let us judge it by its imposing externals of
organization. The Persian Empire was more imposing
than the Republics of Greece: Assyria and Babylon than
the little tribal divisions of Palestine: the Spanish Empire
than the cities of the Netherlands. There is some danger
that, in our new-found sense of the value of knowledge in
promoting happiness, we should forget what a tyrant
knowledge, like wealth, can become. No doubt, just as
we saw that moral qualities, patience and the like, are
needed for the advancement of knowledge, so knowledge
is needed, and greatly needed, in the task of extending
and deepening the moral and spiritual life of mankind.
But we cannot measure that progress in terms of knowledge
or organization or efficiency or culture. We need
some other standard by which to judge between Greece
and Persia, between Israel and Babylon, between Spain
and the Netherlands, between Napoleon and his adversaries,
and between contending powers in the modern
world. What shall that standard be?</p>

<p>It must be a similar standard&mdash;let us boldly say it&mdash;to
that by which we judge between individuals. It must be
a standard based on our sense of right and wrong. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
right and wrong in themselves will not carry us very far,
any more than they will carry the magistrate on the
bench or the merchant in his counting-house. Politics,
like business, is not the whole of life&mdash;though some
party politicians and some business men think otherwise&mdash;but
a department of life: both are means, not ends;
and as such they have developed special rules and codes
of their own, based on experience in their own special
department. In so far as they are framed in accordance
with man's spiritual nature and ideals these rules may be
considered to hold good and to mark the stage of progress
at which Politics and Business have respectively arrived
in promoting the common weal in their own special
sphere. With the rules of business, or what is called
Political Economy, we have at the moment no concern.
It is the rules of politics, or the working experience
of rulers, crystallized in what is called Political Science
or Political Philosophy, to which we must devote a few
moments' attention.</p>

<p>We are all of us, of course, political philosophers.
Whether we have votes or not, whether we are aware of
it or not, we all have views on political philosophy and
we are all constantly making free use of its own peculiar
principles and conceptions. Law, the State, Liberty,
Justice, Democracy are words that are constantly on
our lips. Let us try to form a clear idea of the place
which these great historic ideals occupy in the progress
of mankind.</p>

<p>The great political thinkers of the world have always
been clear in their own minds as to the ultimate goal of
their own particular study. Political thought may be
said to have originated with the Jewish prophets, who were
the first to rebuke kings to their faces and to set forth
the spiritual aims of politics&mdash;to preach Righteousness
and Mercy as against Power and Ambition and Self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>interest.
Their soaring imagination, less systematic than
the Greek intellect, was wider in its sweep and more farseeing
in its predictions. 'As the earth bringeth forth
her bud and as the garden causeth the things sown in it
to spring forth', says Isaiah, in magnificent anticipation
of the doctrine of Natural Law, 'so the Lord God will
cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all
the nations.' 'Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to
him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him: but
the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace,
saith my God, for the wicked.' 'Out of Zion shall go
forth the Law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
And he shall judge between the nations and shall reprove
many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into
plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks: nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It was, however, Plato and Aristotle who first made
politics a branch of separate study: and, unlike many of
their modern successors, they pursued it throughout in
close connexion with the kindred studies of ethics and
psychology. Their scope was, of course, confined to the
field of their own experience, the small self-contained
City-States of Greece, and it did not fall within their
province to foreshadow, like the Jewish Prophets, the end
of warfare, or to speculate on the ultimate unity of
mankind. Their task was to interpret the work of their
own fellow-countrymen on the narrow stage of Greek life.
Their lasting achievement is to have laid down for mankind
what a State is, as compared with other forms of
human association, and to have proclaimed, once and for
all, in set terms, that its object is to promote the 'good
life' of its members. 'Every State', says Aristotle in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the opening words of his <i>Politics</i>, 'is a community of
some kind.' That is to say, States belong to the same
<i>genus</i>, as it were, as political parties, trade unions, cricket
clubs, business houses, or such gatherings as ours. What,
then, is the difference between a State and a political
party? 'If all communities', he goes on, 'aim at some
good, the State or political community, which is the highest
of all and which embraces all the rest, aims, and in a
greater degree than any other, at the highest good.'</p>

<p>Why is the State the highest of all forms of association?
Why should our citizenship, for instance, take precedence
of our trade unionism or our business obligations?
Aristotle replies, and in spite of recent critics I think the
reply still holds good: because, but for the existence of
the State and the reign of law maintained by it, none
of these associations could have been formed or be
maintained. 'He who first founded the State was the
greatest of benefactors. For man, when protected, is
the best of animals, but when separated from law and
righteousness, he is the worst of all.' Or, to put it in the
resounding Elizabethan English of Hooker: 'The public
power of all societies is above every soul contained in
the same societies. And the principal use of that power
is to give laws to all that are under it; which laws, in
such case, we must obey, unless there be reason showed
which may necessarily enforce that the law of Reason or
of God doth enjoin the contrary. Because except our
own private and probable resolutions be by the law of
public determinations overruled, we take away all
possibility of social life in the world.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Greeks did
not deny, as the example of Socrates shows, the right of
private judgement on the question of obedience to law,
or the duty of respect for what Hooker calls the Law of
Reason or of God. Against the authentic voice of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>science
no human authority can or should prevail. But
Aristotle held, with Hooker, that obedience to law and
faithful citizenship are themselves matters normally
ordained by the law of Reason or of God and that, as
against those of any other association (<span class='correction' title='koinônia'>&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#8055;&#945;</span>), the claims
of the State are paramount. In other words, he would
deny what is sometimes loosely called the <i>right</i> of rebellion,
whilst not closing the door to that <i>duty</i> of rebellion which
has so often advanced the cause of liberty. When Aristotle
speaks of the State, moreover, he does not mean a sovereign
authority exercising arbitrary power, as in Persia or
Babylon: he means an authority administering Law and
Justice according to recognized standards: and he is
thinking of Law and Justice, not simply as part of the
apparatus of government but as based upon moral
principles. 'Righteousness', he says, 'is the bond of
men in States and the administration of Justice, which
is the determination of what is righteous, is the principle
of order in political society.' 'Of Law', says Hooker,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
here as elsewhere echoing the ancients, 'there can be no
less acknowledged than that her seat is the bosom of God,
her voice the harmony of the world.' The State takes
precedence of the party or the trade union because,
however idealistic in their policy these latter may be, the
State covers all, not merely a section of the community,
and is able not merely to proclaim but to enforce the rule
of law and justice. Put in modern language, one might
define the Greek idea of the State as the Organization of
Mutual Aid.</p>

<p>The Greek States did not remain true to this high ideal.
Faced with the temptations of power they descended
almost to the level of the oriental monarchies with which
they were contrasted. But even had they remained
faithful to their philosophers' ideal of public service they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
would not have survived. Unable to transcend the limits
of their own narrow State-boundaries and to merge their
ideals with those of their neighbours, they were helpless
in the face of the invader. First Macedonia and then
Rome swept over them, and political idealism slumbered
for many centuries. Rome gave the world, what it
greatly needed, centuries of peace and order and material
prosperity: it built up an enduring fabric of law on
principles of Reason and Humanity: it did much to give
men, what is next to the political sense, the social sense.
It made men members of one another from Scotland to
Syria and from Portugal to Baghdad. But it did not give
them 'the good life' in its fullness: for it did not, perhaps
it could not, give them liberty. Faced with the choice
between efficiency and the diffusion of responsibility, the
rulers of the Roman Empire unhesitatingly chose efficiency.
But the atrophy of responsibility proved the canker at
the heart of the Empire. Deprived of the stimulus that
freedom and the habit of responsibility alone can give,
the Roman world sank gradually into the morass of
Routine. Life lost its savour and grew stale, flat and
unprofitable, as in an old-style Government office. 'The
intolerable sadness inseparable from such a life', says
Renan, 'seemed worse than death.' And when the
barbarians came and overturned the whole fabric of
bureaucracy, though it seemed to educated men at the
time the end of civilization, it was in reality the beginning
of a new life.</p>

<p>Amid the wreckage of the Roman Empire, one governing
institution alone remained upright&mdash;the Christian Church
with its organization for ministering to the spiritual
needs of its members. With the conversion of the barbarians
to Christianity the governing functions and influence
of the Church became more and more important;
and it was upon the basis of Church government that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
political idealism, so long in abeyance, was reawakened.
The thinkers who took up the work of Plato and Aristotle
on the larger stage of the Holy Roman Empire boldly
looked forward to the time when mankind should be
united under one government and that government
should embody the highest ideals of mankind. Such an
ideal seemed indeed to many one of the legacies of the
Founder of Christianity. The familiar petition in the
Lord's Prayer: <i>thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven</i> sounded, in the ears of Dante
and Thomas Aquinas and innumerable theologians and
canonists, as a prayer and a pledge for the ultimate
political unity of mankind on the basis of Christian Law.
Such a belief was indeed the bedrock of mediaeval
political thought. To devout Christians, brought up in
the oecumenical traditions of the Roman Empire,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'every ordering of a human community must appear as
a component part of that ordering of the world which
exists because God exists, and every earthly group must
appear as an organic member of that <i>Civitas Dei</i>, that
God-State, which comprehends the heavens and the
earth.[1] ... Thus the Theory of Human Society must
accept the divinely created organization of the Universe
as a prototype of the first principles which govern the
construction of human communities.... Therefore, in
all centuries of the Middle Age, Christendom, which in
destiny is identical with Mankind, is set before us as
a single, universal Community, founded and governed
by God Himself. Mankind is one "mystical body"; it
is one single and internally connected "people" or "folk";
it is an all-embracing corporation, which constitutes that
Universal Realm, spiritual and temporal, which may be
called the Universal Church, or, with equal propriety,
the Commonwealth of the Human Race. Therefore, that
it may attain its one purpose, it needs One Law and One
Government.'<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>But the mediaeval ideal, like the Greek, broke down
in practice. 'Where the Middle Ages failed', says the
Master of Balliol, continuing a passage already quoted,
'was in attempting ... to make politics the handmaid
of religion, to give the Church the organization and form
of a political State, that is, to turn religion from an indwelling
spirit into an ecclesiastical machinery.' In other
words, the mediaeval attempt broke down through
neglecting the special conditions and problems of the
political department of life, through declining, as it were,
to specialize. While men were discussing the Theory of
the Two Swords, whether the Emperor derived his power
directly from God or indirectly through the Pope, or
whether the sword should be used at all, the actual
work of government in laying the foundations of the good
life was neglected. Not only Liberty but Justice and
Order were largely in abeyance and the range of State
action which we to-day describe as 'social legislation'
was not even dreamed of. Absorbed in theory or wrapped
in ignorance, men forget the practical meaning of Statehood
and its responsibilities. Central Europe languished
for centuries, under a sham Empire, in the unprogressive
anarchy of feudalism. 'The feudal system', it has been
said,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> 'was nothing more nor less than the attempt of
a society which had failed to organize itself as a State,
to make contract do the work of patriotism.' It is the
bitter experience which Germany went through under the
anarchy of feudalism and petty governments, lasting to well
within living memory, which by a natural reaction has led
the German people, under Prussian tutelage, to cling to
the conception of the State as Power and nothing more.</p>

<p>The study of politics had to become secular before it
could once more become practical, and, by being practical,
ministering to practical ideals and enlisting practical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
devotion, become, as it were, sacred once more. Where
the well-being of our fellow men is concerned it is not
enough to be well-meaning. Government is an art, not
an aspiration: and those who are concerned with it,
whether as rulers or voters, should have studied its
problems, reflected on its possibilities and limitations,
and fitted themselves to profit by its accumulated
experience.</p>

<p>Since the close of the Middle Ages, when politics became
secular, the art of government has advanced by giant
strides. Invention has followed invention, and experiment
experiment, till to-day skilled specialists in the Old
World and the New are at hand to watch and to record
the latest devices for dealing with a hundred difficult
special problems&mdash;whether it be the administration of
justice or patronage, the organization of political parties,
the fixing of Cabinet responsibility, the possibilities and
limits of federalism, the prevention of war. There has,
indeed, been as great an advance in the political art in
the last four centuries and particularly in the last century,
as in the very kindred art of medicine. The wonderful
concentration of energy which the various belligerent
powers have been able to throw into the present war is
at once the best and the most tragic illustration of this
truth. Man's common life in the State is more real, more
charged with meaning and responsibility, more potent
for good or for ill than it has ever been before&mdash;than
our predecessors even in the time of Napoleon could have
dreamed of.</p>

<p>The greatest inventors and most skilful practitioners
of the political art in the modern world have been the
English, for it is the English who, of all nations, have held
closest to the ideal of freedom in its many and various
manifestations. Superficially regarded, the English are
a stupid people, and so their continental neighbours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
have often regarded them. But their racial heritage and
their island situation seem to have given them just that
combination of experience and natural endowment
necessary to success in the task of government. Taken
as a whole, the English are not brilliant, but they are
clear-headed: they are not far-sighted, but they can see
the fact before their eyes: they are ill equipped with
theoretical knowledge, but they understand the working
of institutions and have a good eye for judging character:
they have little constructive imagination of the more
grandiose sort, but they have an instinct for the 'next
step' which has often set them on paths which have led
them far further than they dreamed; above all, they have
a relatively high standard of individual character and
public duty, without which no organization involving the
free co-operation of man and man can hope to be effective.
It is this unique endowment of moral qualities and practical
gifts, coupled with unrivalled opportunities, which has
made the English the pioneers in modern times in the art
of human association. Englishmen, accustomed to what
eighteenth-century writers used to call 'the peculiar
felicity of British freedom', do not always remember how
far their own experience has carried them on the road
of political progress. They do not realize how many
problems they have solved and abolished, as the art of
medicine has abolished diseases. When they hear speak
of the eternal conflict between Nationality and Nationality,
they often forget that a war between England and Scotland
has long since become unthinkable and that the platitudes
of St. Andrew's Day are still paradoxes in Central and
Eastern Europe. When they are told of States where the
spontaneous manifestations of group-life, non-conforming
sects, workmen's associations, and ordinary social clubs,
are driven underground and classed as dangerous secret
societies, they should realize how precious a thing is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
freedom of association which is one of the dearest attributes
of English liberty. So too when they read of
monarchical and military supremacy in a country like
Germany, which is still politically speaking in the stage
of England under the Tudors, or of Russian autocracy, or
of the struggle over the King's prerogative which has been
taking place in Greece. If we believe, as we must, in the
cause of liberty, let us not be too modest to say that
nations which have not yet achieved responsible self-government,
whether within or without the British
Commonwealth, are politically backward, and let us recall
the long stages of political invention by which our own
self-government has been achieved. Representation,
trial by jury, an independent judiciary, equality before
the law, habeas corpus, a limited monarchy, the practice
of ministerial responsibility, religious toleration, the
freedom of printing and association, colonial autonomy&mdash;all
these are distinctly English inventions, but time has
shown that most of them are definite additions to the universal
art of government. We can survey the Balkans, for
instance, and say with confidence that one thing, amongst
others, that those nations are in need of is toleration, both
in the sphere of nationality and of religion: or declare
of the United States that their industrial future will be
menaced till they have freed Trade Unionism from the
threat of the so-called law of Conspiracy: or ask of our
own so-called self-governing Dominions whether they are
content with a system that concedes them no responsible
control over the issues of peace and war. This is not to
say that our own governmental machinery is perfect.
Far from it. It was never in greater need of overhauling.
It is only to reaffirm the belief, which no temporary
disillusionment can shake, that it is founded on enduring
principles which are not political but moral. To compare
a system which aims at freedom and seeks to attain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that aim through the working of responsible self-government
with systems, however logically perfect or temporarily
effective, which set no value on either, is, as it were,
to compare black with white. It is to go back on the
lessons of centuries of experience and to deny the cause,
not of liberty alone, but of that progress of the spirit of
man which it is the highest object of liberty to promote.</p>

<p>We have no time here to discuss in detail the various
English inventions in the art of politics, but we must
pause to consider two of the most important, because
they are typical of British methods. The first is the
invention called the Principle of Representation. Representation
is a device by which, and by which alone, the
area of effective government can be extended without the
sacrifice of liberty. It is a device by which the scattered
many can make their will prevail over the few at the centre.
Under any non-representative system, whether in a State
or a Church or a Trade Union or any other association,
men always find themselves set before the inexorable
dilemma between freedom and weakness on the one hand
and strength and tyranny on the other. Either the State
or the association has to be kept small, so that the members
themselves can meet and keep in touch with all that
goes on. Or it is allowed to expand and grow strong, in
which case power becomes concentrated at the centre
and the great body of members loses all effective control.
The ancient world saw no way out of this dilemma. The
great Oriental monarchies never contemplated even the
pretence of popular control. The city-states of Greece,
where democracy originated, set such store in consequence
by the personal liberty of the individual citizen, that
they preferred to remain small, and suffered the inevitable
penalty of their weakness. Rome, growing till she overshadowed
the world, sacrificed liberty in the process.
Nor was the Christian Church, when it became a large-scale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
organization, able to overcome the dilemma. It was not
till thirteenth-century England that a way out was
found. Edward I in summoning two burgesses from each
borough and two knights from each shire to his model
Parliament in 1295, hit on a method of doing business
which was destined to revolutionize the art of government.
He stipulated that the men chosen by their fellows to
confer with him must come, to quote the exact words
of the summons, armed with 'full and sufficient power
for themselves and for the community of the aforesaid
county, and the said citizens and burgesses for themselves
and the communities of the aforesaid cities and boroughs
separately, there and then, for doing what shall then be
ordained according to the Common Council in the premises,
so that the aforesaid business shall not remain unfinished
in any way for defect of this power'. In other words,
the members were to come to confer with the king not as
individuals speaking for themselves alone, but as representatives.
Their words and acts were to bind those on
whose behalf they came, and those who chose them were
to do so in the full knowledge that they would be so
bound. In choosing them the electors deliberately
surrendered their own share of initiative and sovereignty
and combined to bestow it on a fellow citizen whom they
trusted. In this way, and in this way alone, the people
of Cornwall and of Northumberland could bring their
wishes to bear and play their part, together with the people
at the centre, in the government of a country many
times the size of a city-state of ancient Greece. There had
been assemblies before in all ages of history: but this was
something different. It was a Parliament.</p>

<p>Representation seems to us such an obvious device that
we often forget how comparatively modern it is and what
a degree of responsibility and self-control it demands
both in the representative and in those whom he represents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
It is very unpleasant to hear of things done or acquiesced
in by our representatives of which we disapprove, and to
have to remember that it is our own fault for not sending
a wiser or braver man to Westminster in his place. It is
still more unpleasant for a representative to feel, as he
often must, that his own honest opinion and conscience
draw him one way on a matter of business and the opinions
of most of his constituents another. But these are difficulties
inherent in the system, and for which there is no
remedy but sincerity and patience. It is part of the
bargain that a constituency should not be able to disavow
a representative: and that a representative should feel
bound to use his own best judgement on the issues put
before him. To turn the representative, as there is
a tendency to do in some quarters, into a mere mouthpiece
with a mandate, is to ignore the very problem which made
representation necessary, and to presume that a local
mass-meeting can be as well informed or take as wide
a view as those who have all the facts before them at the
centre. The ancient Greeks, who had a strong sense of
individuality, were loth to believe that any one human
being could make a decision on behalf of another. In
the deepest sense of course they were right. But government,
as has been said, is at best a rough business.
Representation is no more than a practical compromise:
but it is a compromise which has been found to work. It
has made possible the extension of free government to
areas undreamed of. It has enabled the general sense of
the inhabitants of the United States, an area nearly as
large as Europe, to be concentrated at Washington, and
it may yet make it possible to collect the sense of self-governing
Dominions in four continents in a Parliament
at London. All this lay implicit in the practical instructions
sent by the English king to his sheriffs; but its
development would only have been possible in a community<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
where the general level of character was a high one and
where men were, therefore, in the habit of placing implicit
trust in one another. The relationship of confidence
between a member of Parliament and his constituents,
or a Trade Union leader and his rank and file, is a thing
of which public men are rightly proud: for it reflects
honour on both parties and testifies to an underlying
community of purpose which no passing disagreement on
details can break down.</p>

<p>Representation paved the way for the modern development
of responsible self-government. But it is important
to recognize that the two are not the same thing. Responsible
self-government, in its modern form, is a separate
and more complex English invention in the art of government.
A community may be decked out with a complete
apparatus of representative institutions and yet remain
little better than an autocracy. Modern Germany is a
case in point. The parliamentary suffrage for the
German Reichstag is more representative than that for
the British House of Commons. The German workman
is better represented in his Parliament than the British
workman is in ours. But the German workman has far
less power to make his will effective in matters of policy
than the British, because the German constitution does
not embody the principle of responsible self-government.
Sovereignty still rests with the Kaiser as it rested in the
thirteenth century with Edward I. The Imperial Chancellor
is not responsible to the Reichstag but to the Kaiser,
by whom he is appointed and whose personal servant he
remains. The Reichstag can discuss the actions of the
Chancellor: it can advise him, or protest to him, or even
pass votes of censure against him; but it cannot make its
will effective. We can observe the working of similar
representative institutions in different parts of the British
Commonwealth. The provinces of India and many British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Colonies have variously composed representative assemblies,
but in all cases without the power to control their
executives. The self-governing Dominions, on the other
hand, do enjoy responsible self-government, but in an
incomplete form, because the most vital of all issues of
policy are outside their control. On questions of foreign
policy, and the issues of war and peace, the Parliaments
of the Dominions, and the citizens they represent,
are, constitutionally speaking, as helpless as the
most ignorant native in the humblest dependency. Representative
institutions in themselves thus no more
ensure real self-government than the setting up of a
works committee of employees in a factory would
ensure that the workmen ran the factory. The distinction
between representation and effective responsibility is so
simple that it seems a platitude to mention it. Yet it
is constantly ignored, both in this country by those
who speak of Colonial self-government as though the
Dominions really enjoyed the same self-government
as the people of these islands, and by the parties in
Germany whose programme it is, not to make Germany
a truly constitutional country, but to assimilate the retrograde
Prussian franchise to the broader representation of
the Reichstag.</p>

<p>Wherein does the transition from representation to
full responsibility consist? It came about in England
when Parliament, instead of merely being consulted by
the sovereign, felt itself strong enough to give orders to
the sovereign. The sovereign naturally resisted, as the
Kaiser and the Tsar will resist in their turn; but in this
country the battle was fought and won in the seventeenth
century. Since that time, with a few vacillations, Parliament
has been the sovereign power. But once this transfer
of sovereignty has taken place, a new problem arises.
A Parliament of several hundred members, even though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
it meets regularly, is not competent to transact the
multitudinous and complex and highly specialized
business of a modern State. The original function of
Parliament was to advise, to discuss, and to criticize. It
is not an instrument fit for the work of execution and
administration. Having become sovereign, its first business
must be to create out of its own members an instrument
which should carry out its own policy and be responsible
to itself for its actions. Hence arose the Cabinet. The
Cabinet is, as it were, a distillation of Parliament, just
as Parliament itself is a distillation of the country. It
consists of members of Parliament and it is in constant
touch with Parliament; but its methods are not the
methods of Parliament but of the older, more direct,
organs of government which Parliament superseded. It
meets in secret: it holds all the strings of policy: it has
almost complete control of political and legislative
initiative: it decides what is to be done and when and
how: it has its own staff of agents and confidential
advisers in the Departments and elsewhere whose acts
are largely withdrawn from the knowledge and criticism
of Parliament. A modern Cabinet in fact is open to the
charge of being autocracy in a new guise. Such a charge
would, of course, be a gross overstatement. But there is
no doubt that the increasing complexity in the tasks of
government has led to a corresponding growth of power
and organization at the centre which has strengthened
the Cabinet immeasurably of recent years at the expense
of the direct representatives of the people. There are, however,
powerful influences at work in the opposite direction,
towards decentralization and new forms of representation,
which there is no space to touch on here. Suffice it to say
that here, as elsewhere, the price of liberty is eternal
vigilance.</p>

<p>England, then, and all who enjoy the full privileges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of British citizenship have been placed by the progress
of events in a position of peculiar responsibility. The
twentieth century finds us the centre of the widest
experiment of self-government which the world has ever
seen; for the principles of liberty, first tested in this
island, have approved themselves on the soil of North
America, Australasia, and South Africa. It finds us also
responsible for the government and for the training in
responsibility of some 350,000,000 members of the more
politically inexperienced and backward races of mankind,
or about one-fifth of the human race. The growth
of the British Commonwealth, about which so astonishingly
little is known either by ourselves or by other
peoples, is not a mere happy or unhappy accident. It
is one of the inevitable and decisive developments in
the history of mankind. It is the direct result of that
widening of intercourse, that internationalizing of the
world, to which reference has already been made. It represents
the control of law and organized government over the
blind and selfish forces of exploitation. In the exercise of
this control we have often ourselves been blind and sometimes
selfish. But 'the situation of man', as Burke
finely said of our Indian Empire, 'is the preceptor of his
duty'. The perseverance of the British character, its habit
of concentration on the work that lies to hand, and the
influence of our traditional social and political ideals, have
slowly brought us to a deeper insight, till to-day the Commonwealth
is becoming alive to the real nature of its task&mdash;the
extension and consolidation of liberty. If it has thus
taken up, in part, the work of the mediaeval Empire and
has had a measure of success where the other failed, it is
because of the character of its individual citizens, because
despite constant and heart-breaking failures in knowledge
and imagination, we are a people who, in the words of a
stern, if friendly, critic, 'with great self-assertion and a bull-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>dog
kind of courage, have yet a singular amount of gentleness
and tenderness'.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have come to the end of our long survey. Some of
you may feel that I have fetched too wide a compass
and given too wide an extension to the meaning of
government. But if I have sinned I have sinned of set
purpose. I refuse to confine government within the limits
of what is ordinarily called politics, or to discuss the
association called the State in isolation from other sides
of man's community life. To do so, I feel, is to lay oneself
open to one of two opposite errors: the error of those
for whom the State is the Almighty, and who invest
it with a superhuman morality and authority of its own;
and the error of those who draw in their skirts in horror
from the touch of what Nietzsche called this 'cold monster'
and take refuge in monastic detachment from the political
responsibilities of their time. We must be able to see
politics as a part of life before we can see it steadily and
see it whole. We must be able to see it in relation to the
general ordering of the world and to connect it once more,
as in the Middle Ages, with religion and morality. No
thinking man can live through such a time as this and
preserve his faith unless he is sustained by the belief
that the clash of States which is darkening our generation
is not a mere blind collision of forces, but has spiritual
bearings which affect each individual living soul born or
to be born in the world. It is not for us to anticipate
the verdict of history. But what we can do is to bear
ourselves worthily, in thought and speech, like our
soldiers in action, of the times in which we live&mdash;to
testify, as it were, in our own lives, to that for which
so many of our friends have laid down theirs. We
are met at a culminating moment of human <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>fate&mdash;when,
so far as human judgement can discern, the
political destinies of this planet are being settled for
many generations to come&mdash;perhaps for good. If the
task of leadership in the arts of government remains with
us, let us face the responsibility conscious of the vast
spiritual issues which it involves, and let us so plan and
act that history, looking back on these years of blood,
may date from them a new birth of freedom and progress,
not for ourselves in this country alone but throughout
that kingdom of Man which must one day, as we believe,
become in very truth the kingdom of God.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN INDUSTRY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A. E. Zimmern</span></h3>


<p>In our study of Government we traced the upward
course of the common life of mankind in the world. We
saw it in the increasing control of Man over his physical
environment, and we saw it also in his clearer realization
of the ultimate ideal of government&mdash;the ordering of the
world's affairs on the basis of liberty. We have now to
turn aside from this main stream of social development
to watch one particular branch of it&mdash;to survey man's
record in the special department of economics. We shall
no longer be studying human history, or the history of
human society, as a whole, but what is known as economic
or industrial history.</p>

<p>It is important to be clear at the outset that economic
or industrial history <i>is</i> a tributary stream and not the
main stream: for there are a number of people who are
of the contrary opinion. There has been an increasing
tendency of recent years to write human history in terms
of economic or industrial progress. 'Tell me what men
ate or wore or manufactured,' say historians of this
school, 'and we will tell you what stage of civilization
he had reached. We will place him in his proper pigeonhole
in our arrangement of the record of human progress.'
Did he use flint implements or fight with nothing but
a bow and arrow? Did he use a canoe with a primitive
pole which he had not even the sense to flatten so as to
make it into a serviceable paddle? Then our sociologist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
will put him very low down on his list of the stages of
human progress. For the modern sociologist is a confirmed
plutocrat. He measures the character of men and races
by their wealth. Just as old-fashioned people still think
of the society of our own country as a hierarchy, in which
the various classes are graded according to their social
prestige and the extent of their possessions: so students
of primitive civilization classify races according to their
material equipment, and can hardly help yielding to the
temptation of reckoning their stage of progress as a whole
by the only available test. Thus it is common, especially
in Germany and the United States, to find histories of
what purports to be the progress of mankind which show
man first as a hunter and a fisherman, then as a shepherd,
then as a tiller of the soil, and then work upwards to the
complicated industrial system of to-day. We are asked
to accept the life of Abraham or David among the sheepfolds
as the bottom of the ladder, and the life of a modern
wage-earner under the smoky sky of a manufacturing
area as the top; and when we complain and say, as men
like William Morris and Stephen Graham are always
saying, that we would far prefer to live in David's world,
in spite of all its discomforts, we are told that we have
no right to quarrel with the sacred principle of Evolution.</p>

<p>To interpret human history in this way is, of course, to
deny its spiritual meaning, to deny that it is a record of
the progress of the human <i>spirit</i> at all. It is to read it
as a tale of the improvement, or rather the increasing
complication, of <i>things</i>, rather than of the advance of
man. It is to view the world as a Domain of Matter, not
as the Kingdom of Man&mdash;still less, as the Kingdom of
God. It is to tie us helplessly to the chariot wheels of an
industrial Juggernaut which knows nothing of moral
values. Let the progress of industry make life noisy and
ugly and anxious and unhappy: let it engross the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mass of mankind in tedious and uncongenial tasks and
the remainder in the foolish and unsatisfying activities
of luxurious living; let it defile the green earth with pits
and factories and slag-heaps and the mean streets of those
who toil at them, and dim the daylight with exhalations
of monstrous vapour. It is not for us to complain or to
resist: for we are in the grip of a Power which is greater
than ourselves, a Power to which mankind in all five
continents has learnt to yield&mdash;that Economic Process
which is, in truth, the God, or the Devil, of the modern
world.</p>

<p>No thinking man dare acquiesce in such a conclusion
or consent to bow the head before such fancied necessities.
The function of industry, he will reply, is to serve human
life not to master it: to beautify human life not to
degrade it: to set life free not to enslave it. Economics
is not the whole of life: and when it transgresses its
bounds and exceeds its functions it must be controlled
and thrust back into its place by the combined activities
of men. The soul is higher than the body, and life is
more than housekeeping. Liberty is higher than Riches,
and the welfare of the community more important than
its economic and material progress. These great processes,
which the increase of man's knowledge has set
in motion, are not impersonal inhuman forces: Men
originated them: men administer them: and men must
control them. Against economic necessity let us set
political necessity: and let the watchword of that
political necessity, here as always, be the freedom and
the well-being of mankind.</p>

<p>With this caution in mind, then, let us approach our
subject.</p>

<p>What is Economics? Economics is simply the Greek
for 'house-keeping'. If writers and thinkers on the
subject had only kept this simple fact in mind, or used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the English word instead of the Greek, the world would
have been saved much misery and confusion. Political
economy is not, what Mill and other writers define it to
be, 'the Science of Wealth'. It is the art of community-housekeeping,
and community-housekeeping, as every
woman knows, is a very important if subsidiary branch
of the art of community-management or government.</p>

<p>Housekeeping, of course, is not a selfish but a social
function. Housewives do not lay in bread and cheese
simply to gratify their own desire to be possessors of
a large store, but for the sake of their household. The
true housekeeper or economic man is the man who is
consciously ministering to the real needs of the community.
Like the ruler or minister in the political sphere, he is
a man who is performing a public service.</p>

<p>This is equally true whether the housekeeper has
a monopoly of the purchase of bread and cheese for the
household, or whether he or she has to compete with
others as to which is to be allowed to serve the public
in that particular transaction. Just as, under the party
system, which seems to be inseparable from the working
of democratic institutions, men stand for Parliament and
compete for the honour of representing their neighbours,
so in most systems of industry men compete for the
honour of supplying the public. Competition in industry
is practically as old as industry. In the earliest picture
that has come down to us of Greek village life we read
of the competition between potter and potter and between
minstrel and minstrel&mdash;a competition as keen and as fierce,
we may be sure, as that between rival shopkeepers to-day.
For the opposite of competition, as has been truly said,
is not co-operation but monopoly or bureaucracy: and
there is no short and easy means of deciding between the
rival systems. Sometimes the community is better
served by entrusting one department wholly to one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
purveyor or one system of management&mdash;as in the Postal
Service, or the Army and Navy. Sometimes it is clearly
better to leave the matter open to competition. Nobody,
for instance, would propose to do with only one minstrel,
and seal the lips of all poets but the Poet Laureate.
Sometimes, as in the case of the organized professions
and the liquor trade, a strictly regulated system of
competition has been considered best. No doubt the
tendency at the present time is setting strongly against
competition and towards more unified and more closely
organized systems of doing business. But it is important
to make quite clear that there is nothing immoral or
anti-social about the fact of competition itself, and
nothing inconsistent with the idea of service and co-operation
which should underlie all social and economic
activity. It is not competition itself, as people often
wrongly think, which is the evil, but the shallow and
selfish motives and the ruthless trampling down of the
weak that are too often associated with it. When we
condemn the maxim 'the Devil take the hindmost', it
is not because we think we ought to treat the hindmost
as though he were the foremost&mdash;to buy cracked jars
or patronize incapable minstrels. It is because we feel
that there is a wrong standard of reward among those
who have pushed to the front, and that the community
as a whole cannot ignore its responsibility towards its
less fortunate and capable members.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, quite impossible to abolish competition
for the patronage of the household without subjecting
its members to tyranny or tying them down to an intolerable
uniformity&mdash;forcing them to suppress their own
temporary likes or dislikes and to go on taking in the
same stuff in the same quantities world without end.
For the most serious and permanent competition is not
that between rival purveyors of the same goods, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
potter and potter and minstrel and minstrel, but between
one set of goods and another: between the potter and
the blacksmith, the minstrel and the painter. If we
abolished competition permanently between the British
railways we could not make sure that the public would
always use them as it does now. People would still be at
liberty to walk or to drive or to bicycle or to fly, or, at
the very worst, to stay at home. Competition, as every
business man knows, sometimes arises from the most
unexpected quarters. The picture-house and the bicycle
have damaged the brewer and the publican. Similarly the
motor-car and the golf links have spoilt the trade in the
fine china ornaments such as used to be common in
expensively furnished drawing-rooms. People sit less in
their rooms, so spend less on decorating them. The
members of the household always retain ultimate control
over their economic life, if they care to exercise it. 'Whoso
has sixpence,' as Carlyle said, 'is sovereign (to the length
of sixpence), over all men; commands Cooks to feed
him, Philosophers to teach him, Kings to mount guard
over him,'&mdash;to the length of sixpence. Passive resistance
and the boycott are always open to the public in the last
resort against any of their servants who has abused the
powers of his position. A good instance of this occurred
in the events which led to the so-called Tobacco riots in
Milan in 1848. The Austrians thought they could force
the Italians in their Lombard provinces to pay for
a government they hated by putting a heavy tax on
tobacco. But the Italians, with more self-control than
we have shown in the present war, with one accord gave
up smoking. Here was a plain competition between
a monopoly and the consumer, between tobacco and
patriotism: between a united household and an unpopular
servant: and the household won, as it always can unless
its members are incapable of combined action or have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
been deprived by governmental tyranny of all power to
associate and to organize.</p>

<p>We are faced then with a community or household
which has certain wants that need to be supplied. The
individual members of the community are justified,
within the limits of general well-being,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in deciding what
are their own wants and how to satisfy them. They
claim the right to <i>demand</i>, as the economists put it, the
goods and services they require, bread and cheese, poetry,
tobacco, motor-bicycles, china ornaments. In order to
meet those demands, which are stable in essentials but
subject to constant modification in detail, there is ceaseless
activity, rivalry, competition, on the part of the
purveyors&mdash;on the side of what economists call <i>supply</i>.
The business of housekeeping, or what is called the economic
process, is that of bringing this demand and this
supply into relation with one another. If the members of
the household said they wanted to eat the moon instead of
sugar, their demand would not be an economic demand:
for no housekeeper could satisfy it. Similarly on the
supply side: if the baker insisted on bringing round bad
epics instead of bread and the grocer bad sonatas instead
of sugar, the supply, however good it might seem to the
baker and the grocer, and however much satisfaction
they might personally have derived from their work,
would not be an economic supply: for the housekeeper,
acting on behalf of the household, would not take it in.
But if the demand was for something not yet available,
but less impossibly remote than the moon, the housekeeper
might persuade the purveyors to cudgel their
brains till they had met the need. For, as we know,
Necessity, which is another word for Demand, is the
mother of invention. Similarly, if a purveyor supplied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
something undreamed of by the household, but otherwise
good of its kind, he might succeed in persuading the
household to like it&mdash;in other words, in creating a demand.
The late Sir Alfred Jones, by putting bananas cheap on
the market, persuaded us that we liked them. Similarly
Mr. Marvin, who deals in something better than bananas,
has persuaded us all to come here, though most of us
would never have thought of it unless he had created the
demand in us.</p>

<p>Economic Progress, then, is progress both on the side
of demand and on the side of supply. It is a progress in
wants as well as in their means of satisfaction: a progress
in the aspirations of the household as well as in the
contrivances of its purveyors: a progress in the sense
of what life might be, as well as in the skill and genius and
organizing powers of those to whom the community
looks for help in the realization of its hopes. It is important
that this double aspect of our subject should be
realized, for in what follows we shall have no opportunity
to dwell further upon it. Space compels us to leave the
household and its wants and aspirations out of account
and to direct our attention solely to the side of supply;
although it must always be remembered that no real and
permanent progress in the organization of production is
possible without improvements in the quality and reduction
in the number of the requirements of what is called
civilization.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> What we have to watch, in our study of
progress in industry, is the history of man as a purveyor
of the household: in other words, as a producer of goods
and services: from the days of the primitive savage with
his bark canoe to the gigantic industrial enterprises of
our own time.</p>

<p>We can best do so by dividing our subject into two on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
somewhat similar lines to the division in our study of
government. Let us consider industry, first as an activity
involving a relationship between man and Nature;
secondly, as involving what may be called a problem of
industrial government, a problem arising out of the
co-operation between man and man in industrial work.
In the first of these aspects we shall see man as a maker,
an inventor, an artist; in the second as a subject
or a citizen, a slave or a free man, in the Industrial
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Man as a maker or producer carries us back to the dawn
of history. Man is a tool-using animal and the early stages
of human history are a record of the elaboration of tools.
The flint axes in our museums are the earliest monuments
of the activity of the human spirit. We do not know
what the cave men of the Old Stone Age said or thought,
or indeed whether they did anything that we should call
speaking or thinking at all; but we know what they
made. Centuries and millenniums elapsed between them
and the first peoples of whom we have any more intimate
record&mdash;centuries during which the foundations of our
existing industrial knowledge and practice were being
steadily laid. 'One may say in general,' says Mr. Marvin,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>that most of the fruitful practical devices of mankind had
their origin in prehistoric times, many of them existing
then with little essential difference. Any one of them
affords a lesson in the gradual elaboration of the simple.
A step minute in itself leads on and on, and so all the
practical arts are built up, a readier and more observant
mind imitating and adapting the work of predecessors,
as we imagined the first man making his first flint axe.
The history of the plough goes back to the elongation of
a bent stick. The wheel would arise from cutting out
the middle of a trunk used as a roller. House architecture
is the imitation with logs and mud of the natural shelters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of the rocks, and begins its great development when men
have learnt to make square corners instead of a rough
circle. And so on with all the arts of life or pleasure,
including clothing, cooking, tilling, sailing, and fighting.</p></div>

<p>How did this gradual progress come about? Mr. Marvin
himself supplies the answer. Through the action of the
'readier and more observant minds'&mdash;in other words,
through specialization and the division of labour. As far
back as we can go in history we find a recognition that
men are not all alike, that some have one gift and some
another, and that it is to the advantage of society to let
each use his own gift in the public service. Among
primitive peoples there has indeed often been a belief
that men are compensated for physical weakness and disability
by peculiar excellence in some sphere of their
own. Hephaestos among the Greek gods was lame: so he
becomes a blacksmith and uses his arms. Homer is blind:
so instead of fighting he sings of war. They would not
go so far as to maintain that all lame men must be good
blacksmiths or all blind men good poets: but at least
they recognized that there was room in the community
for special types and that the blacksmith and the poet
were as useful as the ordinary run of cultivators and
fighting men. The Greek word for craftsman&mdash;<span class='correction' title='dêmiourgos'>&#948;&#951;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#8057;&#962;</span>&mdash;'worker
for the people,' shows how the Greeks felt on
this point. To them poetry and craftsmanship were as
much honourable occupations or, as we should say,
professional activities as fighting and tilling. Whether
Homer took to poetry because he could not fight or
because he had an overwhelming poetic gift, he had
justified his place in the community.</p>

<p>Specialization is the foundation of all craftsmanship
and therefore the source of all industrial progress. We
recognize this, of course, in common speech. 'Practice
makes perfect,' 'Genius is an infinite capacity for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
taking pains,' are only different ways of saying that it is
not enough to be 'ready' and 'observant', but that
continued activity and concentration are necessary.
A perfect industrial community would not be a community
where everybody was doing the same thing: nor would
it be a community where every one was doing just what
he liked at the moment: it would be a community where
every one was putting all his strength into the work
which he was by nature best qualified to do&mdash;where, in
the words of Kipling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall draw the thing as he sees it for the God of Things as They Are.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Progress in industry, then, on this side, consists in increasing
specialization and in the perfection of the relationship
between the workman and his work. Man in this
world is destined to labour, and labour is often described
as the curse of Adam. But in reality, as every one knows
who has tried it, or observed the habits of those who
have, idleness is far more of a curse than labour. Few
men&mdash;at any rate in the temperate zone&mdash;can be consistently
idle and remain happy. The born idler is almost
as rare as the born poet. Most men, and, it must be added,
most women, are happier working. If holidays were the
rule and work the exception the world would be a much
less cheerful place than it is even to-day. Purposeful
activity is as natural to man as playing is to a kitten.
From a purely natural point of view, no one has ever
given a better definition of happiness than Aristotle when
he defined it as <i>an activity of the soul in the direction of
excellence in an unhampered life</i>. By excellence, of course,
in this famous definition, Aristotle does not mean simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
virtue: he means excellence in work. It is impossible,
as we all know, to be good in the abstract. We must be
good in some particular directions, <i>at</i> some particular
thing. And the particular thing that we are good at is <i>our</i>
work, our craft, our art&mdash;or, to use our less aesthetic
English word, for which there is no equivalent in Greek,
our duty. If happiness is to be found in doing one's duty,
it does not result from doing that duty badly, but from
doing it well&mdash;turning out, as we say, a thoroughly good
piece of work, whether a day's work or a life work. There
is a lingering idea, still held in some quarters, that the
more unpleasant an activity is the more virtuous it is.
This is a mere barbarous survival from the days of what
Nietzsche called slave-morality. We are each of us born
with special individual gifts and capacities. There is, if
we only knew it, some particular kind or piece of work
which we are pre-eminently fitted to do&mdash;some particular
activity or profession, be it held in high or in low repute
in the world of to-day, in which we can win the steady
happiness of purposeful labour. Shall we then say that
it ministers to human progress and to the glory of God
deliberately to bury our talent out of sight and to seek
rather work which, because it is irksome and unpleasant
to us, we can never succeed in doing either easily or
really well? No one who knows anything of education
or of the training of the young, no one, indeed, who has
any love for children, would dare to say that we should.
Our State educational system, miserably defective though
it is in this regard, is based upon the idea of ministering
to the special gifts of its pupils&mdash;of trying by scholarships,
by Care Committees, by the institution of schools with
a special 'bias', to meet the needs of different kinds of
young people and to set them in the path on which they
are best fitted to travel.</p>

<p>In doing this the modern State is only trying to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
out the principle laid down in the greatest book ever
written on education&mdash;Plato's <i>Republic</i>. Plato's object
was to train every citizen to fill the one position where he
could lead the best life for the good of the State. His aim
was not to make his citizens happy but to promote
goodness; but he had enough faith in human nature&mdash;and
who can be an educational thinker without having
faith in human nature?&mdash;to be convinced that to enable
men to 'do their bit', as we say to-day, was to assure
them of the truest happiness. We of this generation
know how abundantly that faith has been confirmed. And
indeed we can appeal in this matter not only to the
common sense of Education Authorities or to the philosophy
of the ancients, but to the principles of the Christian
religion. The late Professor Smart, who was not only
a good economist but a good man; has some very pertinent
words on this subject. 'If for some reason that we know
not of,' he remarks,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>this present is merely the first stage in being; if we
are all at school, and not merely pitched into the world
by chance to pick up our living as best we can ... it
seems to me that we have reason enough to complain
of the existing economic system.... I imagine that
many of our churchgoing people, if they ever get to
the heaven they sing about, will find themselves most
uncomfortable, if it be a place for which they have made
no preparation but in the 'business' in which they have
earned their living.... A man's daily work is a far greater
thing towards the development of the God that is in him
than his wealth. And, however revolutionary the idea is,
I must say that all our accumulations of wealth are little
to the purpose of life if they do not tend towards the
giving to all men the opportunity of such work as will
have its reward <i>in the doing</i>.</p></div>

<p>And of his own particular life-work, teaching, he
remarks, in words that testify to his own inner peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and happiness, that 'some of us have got into occupations
which almost seem to guarantee immortality'.</p>

<p>Let us, then, boldly lay it down that the best test of
progress in industry and the best measure of success in
any industrial system is the degree to which it enables
men to 'do their bit' and so to find happiness in their
daily work, or if you prefer more distinctively religious
language, the degree to which it enables men to develop the
God that is in them. Let us have the courage to say that
in the great battle which Ruskin and William Morris
fought almost single-handed against all the Philistines of
the nineteenth century, Ruskin and Morris, however
wrong they may have been on points of practical detail,
were right in principle. Let us make up our minds that
a world in which men have surrendered the best hours
of the day to unsatisfying drudgery, and banished happiness
to their brief periods of tired leisure, is so far from
civilized that it has not even made clear to itself wherein
civilization consists. And when we read such a passage
as the following from a leading modern economist, let us
not yield to the promptings of our lower nature and
acquiesce in its apparent common sense, but remember
that economists, like all workmen, are bounded by the
limits of their own particular craft or study. 'The
greater part of the world's work,' says Professor Taussig,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
the leading exponent of Economics at Harvard,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>is not in itself felt to be pleasurable. Some reformers have
hoped to reach a social system under which all work would
be in itself a source of satisfaction. It is probable that such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
persons are made optimistic by the nature of their own
doings. They are writers, schemers, reformers; they are
usually of strongly altruistic character, and the performance
of any duty or set task brings to them the approval
of an exacting conscience; and they believe that all mankind
can be brought to labour in their own spirit. The
world would be a much happier place if their state of
mind could be made universal. But the great mass of
men are of a humdrum sort, not born with any marked
bent or any loftiness of character. Moreover, most of
the world's work for the satisfaction of our primary
wants must be of a humdrum sort, and often of a rough
and coarse sort. There must be ditching and delving,
sowing and reaping, hammering and sawing, and all the
severe physical exertion which, however lightened by
tools and machinery, yet can never be other than labour
in the ordinary sense of the word.</p></div>

<p>When Professor Taussig assures us that 'the great
mass of men are of a humdrum sort, not born with any
marked bent or loftiness of character' he is simply denying
the Christian religion. To argue the point with him
would carry us too far. We will do no more here than
remind him that the people to whom the Founder of
Christianity preached, and even those who were chosen
to be its first disciples, were, like this audience, distinctly
humdrum, and that assuredly the American Professor
would not have discerned in them promising material
for a world-transforming religious movement. What
people see in others is often a mirror of themselves.
Perhaps Professor Taussig, in spite of his excellent book,
is rather a humdrum person himself.</p>

<p>When, however, Professor Taussig declares that 'the
greater part of the world's work is not in itself felt to be
pleasurable' he is saying what, under existing conditions,
we must all recognize to be true. A year or two ago
Mr. Graham Wallas made an investigation into this very
question, the results of which confirmed the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
impression that modern workmen find little happiness
in their work.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But two of the conclusions which he
reached conflict in a rather curious way with the statement
of Professor Taussig. Mr. Wallas's evidence, which was
largely drawn from students of Ruskin College, led him
to the conclusion 'that there is less pleasantness or happiness
in work the nearer it approaches the fully organized
Great Industry'. The only workman who spoke enthusiastically
of his work was an agricultural labourer who
'was very emphatic with regard to the pleasure to be
obtained from agricultural work'. Professor Taussig,
on the other hand, selects four agricultural occupations,
ditching, delving, sowing, and reaping, as characteristically
unpleasant and looks to machinery and the apparatus
of the Industrial Revolution to counteract this unpleasantness.
But the most interesting evidence gathered by
Mr. Wallas was that relating to women workers. He had
an opportunity of collecting the views of girls employed
in the laundries and poorer kind of factories in Boston.
'The answers', he says,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> 'surprised me greatly. I expected
to hear those complaints about bad wages, hard
conditions and arbitrary discipline which a body of men
working at the same grade of labour would certainly have
put forward. But it was obvious that the question
"Are you happy?" meant to the girls "Are you happier
than you would have been if you had stayed at home
instead of going to work?" And almost every one of
them answered "Yes".' Why were they unhappy at
home? Let Professor Taussig reflect on the answer. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
because they had 'rough' or 'coarse' or 'humdrum'
work to do, as in a factory or laundry, but because they had
nothing to do, and they had found idleness unbearable.
'One said that work "took up her mind", she had been
awfully discontented'. Another that 'you were of some
use'. Another thought 'it was because the hours went so
much faster. At home one could read, but only for
a short time, there was the awful lonesome afternoon
ahead of you.' 'Asked a little girl with dyed hair but
a good little heart. She enjoyed her work. It made her
feel she was worth something.' And Mr. Wallas concludes
that it is just because 'everything that is interesting,
even though it is laborious, in the women's arts of the
old village is gone': because 'clothes are bought ready-made,
food is bought either ready-cooked, like bread
and jam and fish, or only requiring the simplest kind of
cooking': in fact just because physical exertion has been
lightened by books and machinery, that 'there results
a mass of inarticulate unhappiness whose existence has
hardly been indicated by our present method of sociological
enquiry'.</p>

<p>It would seem then that the task of associating modern
industrial work with happiness is not impossible, if we
would only set ourselves to the task. And the task is
a two-fold one. It is, first, to make it possible for people
to follow the employment for which they are by nature
best fitted; and secondly, to study much more closely
than heretofore, from the point of view of happiness,
the conditions under which work is done. The first task
involves a very considerable reversal of current educational
and social values. It does not simply mean paving the
way for the son of an engine-driver to become a doctor
or a lawyer or a cavalryman. It means paving the way
for the son of a duke to become, without any sense of
social failure, an engine-driver or a merchant seaman or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a worker on the land&mdash;and to do so not, as to-day, in
the decent seclusion of British Columbia or Australia,
but in our own country and without losing touch, if he
desires it, with his own natural circle of friends. The
ladder is an old and outworn metaphor in this connexion.
Yet it is still worth remembering that the Angels whom
Jacob observed upon it were both ascending and descending.
It is one of the fallacies of our social system
to believe that a ladder should only be used in one direction&mdash;and
that the direction which tends to remove men
from contact and sympathy with their fellows. But in
truth we need to discard the metaphor of the ladder
altogether, with its implied suggestion that some tasks
of community-service are more honourable and involve
more of what the world calls 'success' than others. We
do not desire a system of education which picks out for
promotion minds gifted with certain kinds of capacity
and stimulates them with the offer of material rewards,
while the so-called humdrum remainder are left, with
their latent talents undiscovered and undeveloped.</p>

<p>Recent educational experiments,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and not least that
most testing of all school examinations, the war, have
shown us that we must revise all our old notions as to
cleverness and stupidity. We know now that, short of
real mental deficiency, there is or ought to be no such
personage as the dunce. Just as the criminal is generally
a man of unusual energy and mental power directed into
wrong channels, so the dunce is a pupil whose special
powers and aptitudes have not revealed themselves in the
routine of school life. And just as the criminal points
to serious defects in our social system, so the dunce points
to serious defects in our educational system. The striking
record of our industrial schools and reformatories in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
war shows what young criminals and dunces can do when
they are given a fair field for their special gifts. One of
the chief lessons to be drawn from the war is the need for
a new spirit and outlook in our national education from
the elementary school to the University. We need a
system which treats every child, rich or poor, as a living
and developing personality, which enables every English
boy and girl to stay at school at least up to the time when
his or her natural bent begins to disclose itself, which
provides for all classes of the community skilled guidance
in the choice of employment based upon psychological
study of individual gifts and aptitude,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which sets up
methods of training and apprenticeship in the different
trades&mdash;or, as I would prefer to call them the different
professions&mdash;such as to counteract the deadening influence
of premature specialization, and which ensures good
conditions and a sense of self-respect and community-service
to all in their self-chosen line of life, whether their
bent be manual or mechanical or commercial or administrative,
or for working on the land or for going to sea, or
towards the more special vocations of teaching or scholarship
or the law or medicine or the cure of souls. No one
can estimate how large a share of the unhappiness
associated with our existing social system is due to the
fact that, owing to defects in our education and our
arrangements for the choice of employment, there are
myriads of square pegs in round holes. This applies with
especial force to women, to whom many of the square
holes are still inaccessible, not simply owing to the lack
of opportunities for individuals, but owing to the inhibitions
of custom and, in some cases, to narrow and retrograde
professional enactments. The war has brought
women their chance, not only in the office and the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>shop,
but in higher administrative and organizing
positions, and not the least of its results is the revelation
of undreamt-of capacities in these directions.</p>

<p>In the second task, that of perfecting the adaptation
between men and their tools, we have much to learn from
the industrial history of the past. It is natural for men
to enjoy 'talking shop', and this esoteric bond of union
has existed between workmen in all ages. We may be
sure that there were discussions amongst connoisseurs
in the Stone Age as to the respective merits of their
flint axes, just as there are to-day between golfers about
niblicks and putters, and between surgeons as to the
technique of the extraction of an appendix. A good workman
loves his tools. He is indeed inseparable from them,
as our law acknowledges by forbidding a bankrupt's
tools to be sold up. Give a good workman, in town or
country, a sympathetic listener and he is only too ready
to expatiate on his daily work. This sense of kinship
between men and their tools and material is so little
understood by some of our modern expert organizers of industry
that it is worth while illustrating it at some length.
I make no apology, therefore, for quoting a striking
passage from an essay by Mr. George Bourne, who is
not a trade unionist or a student of Labour politics but
an observer of English village life, who has taken the
trouble to penetrate the mind of what is commonly
regarded as the stupidest and most backward&mdash;as it is
certainly the least articulate&mdash;class of workmen in this
country, the agricultural labourer in the southern counties.
'The men', he writes,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>are commonly too modest about their work, and too
unconscious that it can interest an outsider, to dream of
discussing it. What they have to say would not therefore
by itself go far in demonstration of their acquirements
in technique. Fortunately, for proof of that we are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
dependent on talk. Besides talk there exists another
kind of evidence open to every one's examination, and
the technical skill exercised in country labours may be
purely deduced from the aptness and singular beauty
of sundry country tools.</p>

<p>The beauty of tools is not accidental, but inherent and
essential. The contours of a ship's sail bellying in the
wind are not more inevitable, nor more graceful, than the
curves of an adze-head or of a plough-share. Cast in
iron or steel, the gracefulness of a plough-share is more
indestructible than the metal, yet pliant (in the limits
of its type) as a line of English blank verse. It changes
for different soils: it is widened out or narrowed; it
is deep-grooved or shallow; not because of caprice at the
foundry or to satisfy an artistic fad, but to meet the
technical demands of the expert ploughman. The most
familiar example of beauty indicating subtle technique
is supplied by the admired shape of boats, which, however,
is so variable (the statement is made on the authority
of an old coast-guardsman) that the boat best adapted
for one stretch of shore may be dangerous, if not entirely
useless, at another stretch ten miles away. And as technique
determines the design of a boat, or of a waggon,
or of a plough-share, so it controls absolutely the fashioning
of tools, and is responsible for any beauty of form they
may possess. Of all tools none, of course, is more exquisite
than a fiddle-bow. But the fiddle-bow never could have
been perfected, because there would have been no call
for its tapering delicacy, its calculated balance of lightness
and strength, had not the violinist's technique reached
such marvellous fineness of power. For it is the accomplished
artist who is fastidious as to his tools; the bungling
beginner can bungle with anything. The fiddle-bow,
however, affords only one example of a rule which is
equally well exemplified by many humbler tools. Quarryman's
peck, coachman's whip, cricket-bat, fishing-rod,
trowel, all have their intimate relation to the skill of those
who use them; and like animals and plants, adapting
themselves each to its own place in the universal order,
they attain to beauty by force of being fit. That law of
adaptation which shapes the wings of a swallow and
prescribes the poise and elegance of the branches of trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
is the same that demands symmetry in the corn-rick and
convexity in the beer-barrel; the same that, exerting
itself with matchless precision through the trained senses
of haymakers and woodmen, gives the final curve to the
handles of their scythes and the shafts of their axes.
Hence the beauty of a tool is an unfailing sign that in
the proper handling of it technique is present ...</p></div>

<p>'It is not the well-informed and those eager to teach',
he says in another passage,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>who know the primitive necessary lore of civilization;
it is the illiterate. In California, Louis Stevenson found
men studying the quality of vines grown on different
pockets of earth, just as the peasants of Burgundy and
the Rhine have done for ages. And even so the English
generations have watched the produce of their varying
soils. When or how was it learnt&mdash;was it at Oxford or
at Cambridge?&mdash;that the apples of Devonshire are so
specially fit for cider? Or how is it that hops are growing&mdash;some
of them planted before living memory&mdash;all along
the strip of green sand which encircles the Weald&mdash;that
curious strip to which text-books at last point
triumphantly as being singularly adapted for hops?
Until it got into the books, this piece of knowledge was
not thought of as learning; it had merely been acted
upon during some centuries. But such knowledge exists,
boundless, in whatever direction one follows it: the
knowledge of fitting means to ends: excellent rule-of-thumb
knowledge, as good as the chemist uses for analyzing
water. When the peculiar values of a plot of land have
been established&mdash;as, for instance, that it is a clay 'too
strong' for bricks&mdash;then further forms of localized knowledge
are brought to supplement this, until at last the
bricks are made. Next, they must be removed from the
field; and immediately new problems arise. The old
farm-cart, designed for roots or manure, has not the most
suitable shape for brick-carting. Probably, too, its wide
wheels, which were intended for the softness of ploughed
land, are needlessly clumsy for the hard road. Soon,
therefore, the local wheelwright begins to lighten his
spokes and felloes, and to make the wheels a trifle less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
'dished'; while his blacksmith binds them in a narrower
but thicker tyre, to which he gives a shade more tightness.
For the wheelwright learns from the carter&mdash;that ignorant
fellow&mdash;the answer to the new problems set by a load of
bricks. A good carter, for his part, is able to adjust
his labour to his locality. A part of his duty consists in
knowing what constitutes a fair load for his horse in the
district where he is working. So many hundred stock
bricks, so many more fewer of the red or wire-cut, such
and such a quantity of sand, or timber, or straw, or coal,
or drain-pipes, or slates, according to their kinds and
sizes, will make as much as an average horse can draw in
this neighbourhood; but in London the loads are bigger
and the vehicles heavier; while in more hilly parts (as
you may see any day in the West Country) two horses
are put before a cart and load which the London carter
would deem hardly too much for a costermonger's
donkey.</p>

<p>So it goes throughout civilization: there is not an
industry but produces its own special knowledge relating
to unclassified details of adjustment.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></div>

<p>It is this craft-knowledge and common professional
feeling which is at the basis of all associations of workpeople,
from the semi-religious societies of ancient times,
which met in secret to worship their patron-god&mdash;Hephaestos,
the god of the metal-workers, or Asclepios, the
god of the doctors&mdash;through the great guilds of the Middle
Ages to the trade unions and professional organizations
of to-day. Trade unions do not exist simply to raise
wages or to fight the capitalist, any more than the British
Medical Association exists simply to raise fees and to
bargain with the Government. They exist to serve
a professional need: to unite men who are doing the same
work and to promote the welfare and dignity of that
work. It is this which renders so difficult the problems
of adjustment which arise owing to the introduction of
new and unfamiliar processes. Professional associations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
are, and are bound to be, conservative: their conservatism
is honourable and to their credit: for they are the
transmitters of a great tradition. The problem in every
case is to ensure the progress necessary to the community
without injury to that sense of 'fellowship in the mystery'
on which the social spirit of the particular class of workmen
depends. It is from this point of view that recent
American proposals in the direction of 'scientific management'
are most open to criticism: for they involve the
break-up of the craft-spirit without setting anything
comparable in its place. In fact, Mr. F. W. Taylor,
one of the inventors of what is called the 'system' of
scientific management, frankly ignores or despises the
craft-spirit and proposes to treat the workman as a being
incapable of understanding the principles underlying the
practice of his art. He goes so far as to lay it down as
a general principle that 'in almost all the mechanic arts
the science which underlies each act of each workman is
so great and amounts to so much that the workman who
is best suited to actually doing the work is incapable of
fully understanding this science, without the guidance
and help of those who are working with him or over him,
either through lack of education or through insufficient
mental capacity'.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Along the lines of this philosophy
no permanent industrial advance is possible. It may
improve the product for a time, but only at the cost of
degrading the producer. If we are to make happiness
our test, and to stand by our definition of happiness
as involving free activity, such a system, destructive as it
is of any real or intense relationship between the workman
and his work, stands self-condemned. If we are looking
for <i>real</i> industrial progress it is elsewhere that we must
turn.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>This leads us naturally on to the second great division
of our subject: progress in the methods of co-operation
between man and man in doing industrial work. For if
man is a social animal his power to do his bit and his
consequent happiness must be derived, in part at least,
from his social environment. The lonely craftsman
perfecting his art in the solitude of a one-man workshop
does not correspond with our industrial ideal any more
than the hermit or the monk corresponds with our general
religious ideal. It was the great apostle of craftsmanship,
William Morris, who best set forth the social ideal of
industry in his immortal sentence: 'Fellowship is Life and
lack of Fellowship is Death.' Our study of the workman,
then, is not complete when we have seen him with his tools:
we must see him also among his workmates. We must see
industry not simply as a process of production but as
a form of association; and we must realize that the
association of human beings for the purpose of industrial
work involves what is just as much a problem of government
as their association in the great political community
which we call the State.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see the record of the progress of industrial
government in clear perspective for the simple reason
that the world is still so backward as regards the organization
of this side of its common life. The theory and practice
of industrial government is generations, even centuries,
behind the theory and practice of politics. We are still
accustomed in industry to attitudes of mind and methods
of management which the political thought of the Western
World has long since discarded as incompatible with its
ideals. Two instances must suffice to illustrate this.
It is constantly being said, both by employers and by
politicians, and even by writers in sympathy with working-class
aspirations, that all that the workman needs in his
life is security. Give him work under decent conditions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
runs the argument, with reasonable security of tenure
and adequate guarantees against sickness, disablement
and unemployment, and all will be well. This theory
of what constitutes industrial welfare is, of course, when
one thinks it out, some six centuries out of date. It
embodies the ideal of the old feudal system, but without
the personal tie between master and man which humanized
the feudal relationship. Feudalism, as we saw in our
study of political government, was a system of contract
between the lord and the labourer by which the lord and
master ran the risks, set on foot the enterprises (chiefly
military), and enjoyed the spoils, incidental to mediaeval
life, while the labourer stuck to his work and received
security and protection in exchange. Feudalism broke
down because it involved too irksome a dependence,
because it was found to be incompatible with the personal
independence which is the birthright of a modern man.
So it is idle to expect that the ideal of security will
carry us very far by itself towards the perfect industrial
commonwealth.</p>

<p>Take a second example of the wide gulf that still
subsists between men's ideas of politics and men's ideas of
industry. It is quite common, even in these latter days,
and among those who have freely sacrificed their nearest
and dearest to the claims of the State, to hear manufacturers
and merchants say that they have a 'right to
a good profit'. The President of the Board of Trade
remarked openly in the House of Commons after many
months of war that it was more than one could expect
of human nature for coal-owners not to get the highest
price they could. Such a standpoint is not merely
indecent: it is hopelessly out-of-date. Looked at from
the political point of view it is a pure anachronism.
There used to be times when men made large fortunes
out of the service of government, as men still make them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
out of the service of the community in trade and industry
to-day. In the days of St. Matthew, when tax-gathering
was let out by contract, the apostle's partners would
probably have declared, as Mr. Runciman does to-day,
that it was more than one could expect of human nature
that a publican who had a government contract for the
collection of the taxes should not get all he could out of
the tax-payer. It is, indeed, little more than a century
ago since it was a matter of course in this country to
look upon oversea colonies merely as plantations&mdash;that
is, as business investments rather than as communities
of human beings. The existence of Chartered Company
government marks a survival of this habit of mind.
The old colonial system, which embodied this point of
view, proved demoralizing not only to the home government
but to the colonists, as a similar view is to the working
class, and it led to the loss of the American colonies
as surely as a similar attitude on the part of employers
leads to unrest and rebellion among workpeople to-day.</p>

<p>We have thus a long way to travel before the ideals
of politics have been assimilated into the industrial life
of the community and have found fitting embodiment
in its kindred and more complex problems. But at
least we have reached a point where we can see what the
problem of industrial government is. We can say with
assurance that a system which treats human beings
purely as instruments or as passive servants, and atrophies
their self-determination and their sense of individual and
corporate responsibility, is as far from perfection in
industry as the Roman Empire was in politics. Renan's
words about 'the intolerable sadness' incidental to such
a method of organization apply with redoubled force
to occupations which take up the best part of the day
of the mass of the working population. The bleak and
loveless buildings, with their belching chimneys, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
arrest the eye of the thoughtful traveller in the industrial
districts of England are not prisons or workhouses. But
they often look as if they were, and they resemble them in
this&mdash;that they too often stand for similarly authoritarian
ideas of government and direction. Industry is still an
autocracy, as politics was in the days before the supremacy
of Parliament. Power still descends from above instead
of springing from below. It is a power limited no doubt
by trade union action and parliamentary and administrative
control: but it is in essence as autocratic as the
government of England used to be before the transference
of sovereignty from the monarch to the representatives
of his subjects. It was recently announced in the press
that Lord Rhondda had bought a group of Welsh collieries
for 2 millions, and that as a result 'Lord Rhondda now
controls over 3-1/2 millions of capital, pays 2-1/2 millions in wages
every year, and is virtually the dictator of the economic
destiny of a quarter of a million miners. Rumours are
also current', the extract continues, 'that Lord Rhondda
is extending his control over the press of Wales'.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The
existence of such power in this twentieth century in the
hands of single individuals, not selected from the mass
for their special wisdom or humanity, is a stupendous
fact which must give pause to any one who is inclined to
feel complacent about modern industrial progress. In
days gone by political power was as irresponsible as the
economic power wielded to-day by Lord Rhondda; and
it descended from father to son by hereditary right in
the same way as the control over the lives of countless
American workers descends to-day as a matter of course
from John D. Rockefeller senior to John D. Rockefeller
junior. If there is any reality at all in our political
faith we must believe that a similar development towards
self-government can and must take place in industry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
It may be that generations will elapse before the problems
of industrial government find a final and satisfactory
constitutional solution. But at least we can say that
there is only one basis for that solution which is compatible
with a sound ideal of government, or indeed with any
reasoned view of morality or religion&mdash;the basis of individual
and corporate freedom with its corresponding
obligations of responsibility and self-respect. No nation,
as Abraham Lincoln said, can remain half-slave and
half-free: and it was a greater than Lincoln who warned
us that we cannot serve both God and Mammon. It is
this underlying conflict of ideals in the organization of
our existing economic system which is the real cause of
the 'Labour unrest' of which we have heard so much
in recent years.</p>

<p>With this warning in our minds as to the imperfections
of our modern industrial organization, let us briefly
survey the record of the forms of economic association
which preceded it.</p>

<p>The earliest form of industrial grouping is, of course,
the family; and the family, as we all know, still retains
its primitive character in some occupations as a convenient
form of productive association. This is particularly the
case in agriculture in communities where peasant holdings
prevail. But the family is so much more than an industrial
group that it hardly falls to us to consider it further here.</p>

<p>Outside the family proper, industrial work among
primitive peoples is often carried on by slaves. It was
a step forward in human progress when primitive man
found that it was more advantageous to capture his
enemies than to kill or eat them; and it was a still greater
step forward when he found that there was more to be
got out of slaves by kind treatment than by compulsion.
This is not the place in which to go into the vexed questions
connected with various forms of slavery. Suffice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
it to say that it is a profound mistake to dismiss the whole
system in one undiscriminating condemnation. Slavery
involves the denial of freedom, and as such it can never
be good. But other systems besides slavery implicitly
involve the denial of freedom. Some of the finest artistic
work in the world has been done by slaves&mdash;and by
slaves not working under compulsion but in the company
of free men and on terms of industrial equality with them.
This should serve to remind us that, in judging of systems
of industry, we must look behind the letter of the law to
the spirit of the times and of social institutions. Slavery
at its best merges insensibly into wage-labour at its
lower end. Many of the skilled slaves of ancient Greece
and Rome are hardly distinguishable in status from a
modern workman bound by an unusually long and strict
indenture and paid for his work not only in money but
partly in truck. In order to stimulate their productive
capacity it was found necessary in Greece and Rome to
allow skilled slaves to earn and retain money&mdash;although
in the eye of the law they were not entitled to do so; and
they were thus frequently in a position to purchase their
own freedom and become independent craftsmen. Slavery
in the household and in small workshops is open to many
and serious dangers, which need not be particularized here;
but the worst abuses of slavery have always taken place
where slaves have been easily recruited, as in the early
days of European contact with Africa, and when there
were large openings for their employment in gangs on
work of a rough and unskilled character. The problem
of slavery in its worse forms is thus at bottom a cheap-labour
problem analogous to that which confronts North
America and South Africa to-day; and there is an
essential difference which is often ignored between the
educated slave in a Roman Government office who did
the work of a First Division Civil Servant for his imperial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
master and his compeer working in the fields of South
Italy: and between the household servants of a Virginian
family and the plantation-slaves of the farther South. Let
us remember, in passing judgement on what is admittedly
an indefensible system, that during the war which
resulted in the freeing of the American slaves the slaveholders
of the South trusted their household slaves to
protect the women and children during their absence from
home and that that trust was nowhere betrayed. There
is another side to <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> as surely as there is
another side to Mr. Carnegie's paean of modern industrialism
in his <i>Triumphant Democracy</i>.</p>

<p>Systems of serfdom or caste which bind the workman
to his work without permitting him to be sold like a slave
may be regarded as one step higher than slavery proper.
Such systems are common in stable and custom-bound
countries, and persisted throughout the European Middle
Ages. We need not describe how the rising tide of change
gradually broke up the system in this country and left the
old-time villein a free but often a landless and property less
man. The transition from serfdom to the system of
wage-labour which succeeded it was a transition from
legal dependence to legal freedom, and as such it marked
an advance. But it was also a transition from a fixed
and, as it were, a professional position of service to the
community to a blind and precarious individualism. It
was a transition, as Sir Henry Maine put it, from status to
contract. This famous nineteenth-century aphorism is
eloquent of the limitations of that too purely commercial
age. Every thinking man would admit to-day that
status at its best is a better thing than contract at its
best&mdash;that the soldier is a nobler figure than the army
contractor, and that corporate feeling and professional
honour are a better stimulus to right action than business
competition and a laudable keenness to give satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to a valuable customer. We have always suffered from
the temptation in this country of adapting business
methods and ideals to politics rather than political
ideals and methods to business. Our eighteenth-century
thinkers explained citizenship itself, not as a duty to our
neighbours but as the fulfilment of an unwritten contract.
Our nineteenth-century legal writers elevated the idea
of free contract almost to an industrial ideal; while, in
somewhat the same spirit, the gutter journalists of to-day,
when they are at a loss for a popular watchword, call for
a business government. Such theories and battle-cries
may serve for a 'nation of shopkeepers'; but that
opprobrious phrase has never been true of the great
mass of the English people, and it was never less true
than to-day.</p>

<p>The idea of industrial work as the fulfilment of a contract,
whether freely or forcibly made, is thus essentially
at variance with the ideal of community service. It is
difficult for a man who makes his livelihood by hiring
himself out as an individual for what he can get out of
one piece of work after another to feel the same sense
of community service or professional pride as the man
who is serving a vocation and has dedicated his talents
to some continuous and recognized form of work. It
is this which makes the system of wage-labour so unsatisfactory
in principle compared with the guilds of the
town workmen in the Middle Ages and with the organized
professions of to-day; and it is this which explains why
trade unions of recent years have come to concern
themselves more and more with questions of status rather
than of wages and to regard the occupation which they
represent more and more as a profession rather than a
trade. No one has laid bare the deficiencies of the wage-system
more clearly than Adam Smith in the famous
chapter in which he foreshadows the principle of collective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
bargaining. 'What are the common wages of labour',
he there remarks,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'depends everywhere upon the contract usually made
between those two parties, whose interests are by no
means the same. The workmen desire to get as much,
the masters to give as little, as possible. The former
are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter
in order to lower, the wages of labour.... We rarely
hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters,
though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever
imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine
is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are
always and everywhere in a sort of tacit but constant and
uniform combination not to raise the wages of labour
above their actual rate. To violate this combination is
everywhere a most unpopular action and a sort of reproach
to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom,
indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual,
and one may say, the natural state of things which
nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into
particular combinations to sink the wages of labour
even below this rate. These are always conducted with
the utmost secrecy till the moment of execution; and,
when the workmen yield, as they sometimes do without
resistance, though severely felt by them, they are never
heard of by other people. Such combinations, however,
are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination
of the workmen, who sometimes, too, without any
provocation of this kind, combine of their own accord to
raise the price of labour. Their usual pretences are,
sometimes the high price of provisions, sometimes the
great profit which their masters make by their work.'</p></div>

<p>These words were written 140 years ago, but, as we all
know, they are still true of the working of the system
to-day. Indeed the war has served to emphasize their
truth by showing us how deeply entrenched are the habits
of bargaining and of latent antagonism which the working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the wage-system has engendered. It is the defect of
the wage-system, as Adam Smith makes clear to us, that
it lays stress on just those points in the industrial process
where the interests of employers and workpeople
run contrary to one another, whilst obscuring those far
more important aspects in which they are partners and
fellow-workers in the service of the community. This
defect cannot be overcome by strengthening one party
to the contract at the expense of the other, by crushing
trade unions or dissolving employers' combinations, or
even by establishing the principle of collective bargaining.
It can only be overcome by the recognition on both sides
that industry is in essence not a matter of contract and
bargaining at all, but of mutual interdependence and
community service: and by the growth of a new ideal
of status, a new sense of professional pride and corporate
duty and self-respect among all who are engaged in the
same function. No one can say how long it may take
to bring about such a fundamental change of attitude,
especially among those who have most to lose, in the
material sense, by an alteration in the existing distribution
of economic power. But the war has cleared away so
much of prejudice and set so much of our life in a new
light that the dim ideals of to-day may well be the
realities of to-morrow. This at least we can say: that no
country in the world is in a better position than we are
to redeem modern industry from the reproach of materialism
and to set it firmly upon a spiritual basis, and that
the country which shall first have had the wisdom and
the courage to do so will be the pioneer in a vast extension
of human liberty and happiness and will have shown
that along this road and no other lies the industrial
progress of mankind.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN ART</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A. Clutton Brock</span></h3>


<p>It is often said that there can be no such thing as
progress in art. At one time the arts flourish, at another
they decay: but, as Whistler put it, art happens as
men of genius happen; and men cannot make it happen.
They cannot discover what circumstances favour art,
and therefore they cannot attempt to produce those
circumstances. There are periods of course in which the
arts, or some one particular art, progress. One generation
may excel the last; through several generations an art
may seem to be rushing to its consummation. This
happened with Greek sculpture and the Greek drama
in the sixth and fifth centuries; with architecture and
all kindred arts in western Europe in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and at the same time with many arts
in China. It happened with painting and sculpture in
Italy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with
literature in England in the sixteenth century, with
music in Germany in the eighteenth century and the
beginning of the nineteenth. But in all these cases there
followed a decline, often quite unconscious at the time
and one of which we cannot discover the causes. Attempts
are made by historians of the arts to state the causes;
but they satisfy only those who make them, for they are,
in fact, only statements of the symptoms of decline.
They tell us what happened, not why it happened. And
they all seem to point to two conclusions about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
course of the arts, both of which would make us despair
of any settled progress in them. The first is that the
practice of any art by any particular people always
follows a certain natural course of growth, culmination,
and decay. At least it always follows this course where
an art is practised naturally and therefore with success.
Art in fact, in its actual manifestations, is like the life
of an individual human being and subject to inexorable
natural laws. It is born, as men are born, without the
exercise of will; and in the same way it passes through
youth, maturity, and old age. The second conclusion
follows from this, and it is that one nation or age cannot
take up an art where another has left it. That is where
art seems to differ from science. The mass of knowledge
acquired in one country can, if that country loses energy
to apply or increase it, be utilized by another. But we
cannot so make use of the art of the Greeks or of the
Italian Renaissance or of our own Middle Ages. In the
Gothic revival we tried to make use of the art of the
Middle Ages and we failed disastrously. We imitated
without understanding, and we could not understand
because we were not ourselves living in the Middle Ages.
Art, in fact, is always a growth of its own time which
cannot be transplanted, and no one can tell why it
grows in one time and among one people and not in
another.</p>

<p>That is what we are always told, and yet we never
quite believe all of it. For, as art is a product of the human
mind, it must also be a product of the human will, unless
it is altogether unconscious like a dream. But that it is
not; for men produce it in their waking hours and with
the conscious exercise of their faculties. If a man paints
a picture he does so because he wants to paint one. He
exercises will and choice in all his actions, and the man
who buys a picture does the same. We talk of inspiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in the arts as something that cannot be commanded, but
there is also inspiration in the sciences. No man can
make a scientific discovery by the pure exercise of his will.
It jumps into one mind and not into another just like an
artistic inspiration. And further we are taught and trained
in the arts as in the sciences; and success in both depends
a great deal upon the nature of the training. In both
good training will not give genius or inspiration to those
who are without it; but it will enable those who possess
it to make the most of it; and, what is more, it will
enable even the mediocre to produce work of some value.
What strikes us most about the Florentine school of
painting of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is the
fact that its second-rate painters are so good, that
we can enjoy their works even when they are merely
imitative. But the Florentine school excelled all others
of the time in its teaching; most painters of other
schools in Italy learnt from Florence; and the inspiration
came to them from Florence, they were quickened from
Florence, however much their art kept its own natural
character. But this school which had the best teaching
also produced the most painters of genius. Its level was
higher and its heights were higher; and for this reason,
that the whole Florentine intellect went both into the
teaching and into the practice of painting and sculpture.
The Florentine was able to put all his mind, the scientific
faculties as well as the aesthetic, into his art. He never
relied merely on his temperament or his mood. He was
eager for knowledge. It was not enough for him to paint
things as he saw them; he tried to discover how they
were made, what were the laws of their growth and
construction; and his knowledge of these things changed
the character of his vision, made him see the human body,
for instance, as no mediaeval artist had ever seen it;
made him see it as an engineer sees a machine. Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
as an engineer sees more in a machine than a man who
does not understand its working, so the Florentine saw
more in the human body than a mediaeval artist. He saw
it with a scientific as well as an aesthetic passion, and all
this science of his enriched his art so that there has never
since been drawing like the Florentine, drawing at once
so logical and so expressive.</p>

<p>The Florentines in fact did exercise their will upon their
art more than any other modern artists, more, perhaps,
than any other artists known to us, and their painting
and sculpture were the greatest of the modern world.
Yet the fact remains that Florentine art declined suddenly
and irresistibly, and that all the Florentine intellect, which
still remained remarkable and produced men of science
like Galileo, could not arrest that decline. Indeed the
Florentines themselves seem not to have been conscious
of it. They thought that the dull imitators of Michelangelo
were greater than his great predecessors. As we
say, their taste became bad, their values were perverted;
and with that perversion all their natural genius for the
arts was wasted. To this day Carlo Dolci is the favourite
painter of the ordinary Florentine. He was a man of
some ability, and he painted pictures at once feeble and
revolting because he himself and his public liked such
pictures.</p>

<p>There is no accounting for tastes, we say, and in saying
that we despair of progress in the arts. For it is ultimately
this unaccountable thing called taste, and not the absence
or presence of genius, which determines whether the arts
shall thrive or decay in any particular age or country.
People often say that they know nothing about art, but
that they do know what they like; and what they imply
is that there is nothing to be known about art except
your own likes and dislikes, and further that no man can
control those. The Florentines of the seventeenth century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
happened to like Carlo Dolci, where the Florentines of the
fifteenth had liked Botticelli. That is the only explanation
we can give of the decline of Florentine painting.</p>

<p>It is of course no explanation; and because no explanation
beyond it has been given, we are told that there can
be no such thing as progress in the arts. That is the
lesson of history. We are far beyond the Egyptians in
science, but certainly not beyond them in art. Indeed
one might say that there has been a continual slow
decline in all the arts of Europe, except music, since the
year 1500, and that music itself has been slowly declining
since the death of Beethoven. But with this slow inexorable
decline of the arts there has been a great advance
in nearly everything else, in knowledge, in power, even
in morality. Upon everything man has been able to
exercise his will except upon the arts. Where he has
really wished for progress there he has got it, except in
this one case. Therefore it seems that upon the arts he
cannot exercise his will, and that they alone of all his
activities are not capable of progress. What do we mean
by progress except the successful exercise of the human will
in a right direction? That is what distinguishes progress
from natural growth; that alone can preserve it from
natural processes of decay. There are people who say
that it does not exist, that everything which happens
to man is a natural process of growth or decay. Whether
that is so or not, we do mean by progress something
different from these natural processes. When we speak
of it we do imply the exercise of the human will, man's
command over circumstances; and those who deny
progress altogether deny that man has any will or any
command over circumstances. For them things happen
to man and that is all, it is not man's will that makes
things happen. But if we use the word progress at all,
we imply that it is man's will that makes things happen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
And since man is evidently liable to decline as well as
progress, it follows that if we believe man to be capable
of exercising his will in a right direction we must also
believe that he can and does exercise it in a wrong direction.
I assume that man has this power both for good and for
evil. If I did not, I should not be addressing you upon the
question whether man is capable of progress in the arts,
but upon the question whether he is capable of progress
at all. And I should be trying to prove that he is not.</p>

<p>As it is, the question I have to discuss is whether he
has the power of exercising for good or evil his will upon
the arts as upon other things; and hitherto I have been
giving you certain facts in the history of the arts which
seem to prove that he is not. They all amount to
this&mdash;that man has not hitherto succeeded in exercising
his will upon the arts; that he has not produced
good art because he wished to produce it. We, for
instance, wish to excel in the arts; we have far more
power than the ancient Greeks or Egyptians; but we
have not been able to apply that power to the
arts. In them we are conscious of a strange impotence.
We cannot build like our forefathers of the
Middle Ages, we cannot make furniture like our great-grandfathers
of the eighteenth century. Go into an old
churchyard and look at the tombstones of the past and
present. You will see that the lettering is always fine
up to the first generation of the nineteenth century.
In that generation there is a rapid decline; and since
about 1830 there has been no decent lettering upon
tombstones except what has been produced in the last
ten years or so by the conscious effort of a few individual
artists of great natural talent and high training. If I want
good lettering on a tombstone I have to employ one of
these artists and to pay him a high price for his talent
and his training. But that is only one example of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
universal decline in all the arts of use, a decline which
happened roughly between the years 1800 and 1830.
And the significant fact about it is that when it happened
no one was aware of it. So far as I know, this artistic
catastrophe, far the swiftest and most universal known
to us in the whole course of history, was never even
mentioned in contemporary literature. The poets, the
lovers of beauty, did not speak of it. They talked
about nature, not about art. There is not a hint of it in
the letters of Shelley or Keats. There is just a hint of
it in some sayings of Blake; but that is all. One would
suppose that such a catastrophe would have filled the
minds of all men who were not entirely occupied with
the struggle for life, that all would have seen that a glory
was passing away from the earth, and would have made
some desperate struggle to preserve it. But, as I say,
they saw nothing of it. They were not aware that a universal
ugliness was taking the place of beauty in all things
made by man; and therefore the new ugliness must
have pleased them as much as the old beauty. So it
appears once again that there is no accounting for tastes,
and no test that we can apply to them. When science
declines, men at least know that they have less power.
They are more subject to pestilence when they forget
medicine and sanitation; their machines become useless
to them when they no longer know how to work them;
there is anarchy when they lose their political goodwill.
But when their taste decays they do not know that it
has decayed. And with it decays their artistic capacity, so
that, quite complacently, they lose the power of doing
decently a thousand things that their fathers did excellently.</p>

<p>But here suddenly I am brought to a stop by a new
fact in human history. The arts have declined, but our
complacency over their decline has ceased. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
man who disturbed it was Ruskin. It was he who saw
the catastrophe that had happened. Suddenly he was
aware of it; suddenly he escaped from the universal
tyranny of the bad taste of his time. He was the first
to deny that there was no accounting for tastes; the first
to deny, indeed, that the ordinary man did know what he
liked. And he was followed with more knowledge and
practical power, in fact with more science, by William
Morris. What both of these great men really said was
that taste is not unaccountable; that the mass of men
do not know what they like, that they do not apply
their intellect and will to what they suppose to be
their likes and dislikes, and that they could apply their
intellect and will to these things if they chose.</p>

<p>When we say that there is no accounting for tastes
we imply that tastes are always real, that, whether good
or bad, they happen to men without any exercise of their
will. But Ruskin and Morris implied that we must
exercise our will and our intelligence to discover what our
tastes really are; that this discovery is not at all easy,
but that, if we do not make it, we are at the mercy, not
of our own real tastes, but of an unreal thing which is
called the public taste, or of equally unreal reactions
against it. We think that we like what we suppose other
people to like, and these other people too think that they
like what no one really likes. Or in mere blind reaction
we think that we dislike what the mob likes. But in
either case our likes and dislikes are not ours at all and,
what is more, they are no one's. Taste in fact is bad
because it is not any one's taste, because no one's will
is exercised in it or upon it. When it is good, it is always
real taste, that is to say some real person's taste. In
the work of art the artist does what he really likes to do
and expresses some real passion of his own, not some
passion which he believes that he, as an artist, ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
express. Art, said Morris, is the expression of the workman's
pleasure in his work. It cannot be real art unless
it is a real pleasure. And so the public will not demand real
art unless they too take a real pleasure in it. If they do
not know what they really like, they will not demand
of the artist what they really like or what he really
likes. They will demand something tiresome and insincere,
and by the tyranny of their demand will set him to
produce it.</p>

<p>That was what happened at the beginning of the nineteenth
century in nearly all the arts and especially in
the arts of use. It had happened before in different ages
and countries, especially in painting, sculpture, architecture,
and the arts of use as they were patronized by the
vulgar rich, such as the court of Louis XV. But now it
happened suddenly and universally to all arts. There
were no longer vulgar rich only but also vulgar poor and
vulgar middle-classes. Everywhere there spread a kind
of aesthetic snobbery which obscured real tastes. Of
this I will give one simple and homely example. The
beautiful flowers of the cottage garden were no longer
grown in the gardens of the well-to-do, because they were
the flowers of the poor. Instead were grown lobelias,
geraniums, and calceolarias, combined in a hideous
mixture, not because any one thought them more beautiful,
but because, since they were grown in green-houses,
they implied the possession of green-houses and so of
wealth. They did not, of course, even do that, since they
could be bought very cheaply from nurserymen. They
implied only the bad taste of snobbery which is the absence
of all real taste. For it is physically impossible for any
one to like such a combination of plants better than
larkspurs and lilies and roses. What they did enjoy
was not the flowers themselves but their association with
gentility. But so strong was the contagion of this associa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>tion
that cottagers themselves began to throw away
their beautiful cottage-garden flowers and to grow these
plants, so detestable in combination. And to this day
one can see often in cottage gardens pathetic imitations
of a taste that never was real and which now is discredited
among the rich, so that a border of lobelias, calceolarias,
and geraniums has become a mark of social inferiority as
it was once one of social superiority. But what it never
was and never could be was an expression of a genuine
liking.</p>

<p>Now I owe the very fact that I am able to give this
account of a simple perversion of taste to Ruskin and
Morris. It was they who first made the world aware
that its taste was perverted and that most of its art was
therefore bad. It was they who filled us with the conviction
of artistic sin, and who also in a manner entirely
scientific tried to discover what was the nature of this
sin and how it had come about. First Ruskin tentatively,
and afterwards Morris systematically and out of his own
vast artistic experience, connected this decay of the arts
with certain social conditions. It was not merely that
taste had decayed or that the arts had developed to
a point beyond which there was nothing for them but
decline. Morris insisted that there were causes for the
decay of taste and the decline of the arts, causes as much
subject to the will of man as the causes of any kind of
social decay or iniquity. He insisted that a work of art
is not an irrational mystery, not something that happens
and may happen well or ill; but that all art is intimately
connected with the whole of our social well-being. It is
in fact an expression of what we value, and if we value
noble things it will be noble, if we pretend to value base
things it will be base.</p>

<p>Whistler said that this was not so. He insisted that
genius is born, not made, and that some peoples have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
artistic capacity, some have not. Now it is true that
nations vary very much in their artistic capacity and in
the strength of their desire to produce art. But even the
nations which have little artistic capacity and little desire
to produce art have in their more primitive state produced
charming works of real art. Whistler gave the case of
the Swiss as an excellent people with little capacity for
art. But the old Swiss chalets are full of character and
beauty, and there are churches in Switzerland which have
all the beauty of the Middle Ages. The cuckoo clocks
and other Swiss articles of commerce which Whistler
despised are contemptible, not because they are Swiss,
but because they are tourist trash produced by workmen
who express no pleasure of their own in them for visitors
who buy them only because they think they are characteristic
of Switzerland. They are, in fact, not the expression
of any genuine taste or liking whatever, like the tourist
trash that is sold in the Rue de Rivoli. Probably the
Swiss would never be capable of producing works of art like
Chartres Cathedral or Don Giovanni, but they have in the
past possessed a genuine and delightful art of their own
like nearly every European nation in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>So, though genius is born, it is also made, and though
nations differ in artistic capacity, they all have some
artistic capacity so long as they know what they like and
express only their own liking in their art, so long as they
are not infected with artistic snobbism or commercialism.
This we know now, and we have developed a new and
remarkable power of seeing and enjoying all the genuine
art of the past. This power is part of the historical sense
which is itself modern. In the past, until the nineteenth
century, very few people could see any beauty or meaning
in any art of the past that did not resemble the art of
their own time and country. The whole art of the
Middle Ages, for instance, was thought to be merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
barbarous until the Gothic revival, and so was the art of
all the past so far as it was known, except the later art
of Greece and Rome. For our ancestors' taste did indeed
happen as art happened, and they could not escape
from the taste which circumstances imposed on them; any
art that was not according to that taste was for them as
it were in an unknown tongue. But we have made this
great progress in taste, at least, if not in the production
of art, that we can understand nearly all artistic languages,
and that what used to be called classical art has lost its
old superstitious prestige for us. Not only can we enjoy
the art of our own Middle Ages; but many of us can enjoy
and understand just as well the great art of Egypt and
China, and can see as clearly when that art is good or
bad as if it were of our own time. We have, in fact,
in the matter of artistic appreciation gained the freedom
of all the ages, and this is a thing that has never, so far
as we know, happened before in the history of the human
mind.</p>

<p>But still this freedom of all the ages has not enabled
us to produce a great art of our own. There are some,
indeed, who think that it has hindered us from doing so,
that we are becoming merely universal connoisseurs
who can criticize anything and produce nothing. We
have the most wonderful museums that ever were, and
the most wonderful power of enjoying all that is in them,
but, with all our riches from the past, our present is barren;
and it is barren because our rich men would rather pay
great prices for past treasures than encourage artists
to produce masterpieces now. If that is so, if that is all
that is coming to us from our freedom of all the ages,
there is certainly not progress in it. Better that we should
produce and enjoy the humblest genuine art of our own
than that we should continue in this learned impotence.</p>

<p>But this power of enjoying the art of all ages, though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
certainly has had some unfortunate results, must be good
in itself. It is sympathy, and that is always better than
indifference or antipathy. It is knowledge, and that is
always better than ignorance. And we have to remember
that it has existed only for a short time and is, therefore,
not yet to be judged by its fruits. We are still gasping
at all the artistic treasures of the past that have been
revealed to us like a new world; and still they are being
revealed to our new perceptions. Only in the last ten
years, for instance, have we discovered that Chinese
painting is the rival of Italian, or that the golden age of
Chinese pottery was centuries before the time of that
Chinese porcelain which we have hitherto admired so
much. The knowledge, the delight, is still being gathered
in with both hands. It is too soon to look for its effects
upon the mind of Europe.</p>

<p>But it is not the result of mere barren connoisseurship
or scholasticism. Rather it is a new renaissance, a new
effort of the human spirit, and an effort after what? An
effort to exert the human will in the matter of art far more
consciously than it has exerted ever before. It is to
be noted that Morris himself, the man who first told us
that we must exert our wills in art, was also himself
eager in the discovery and enjoyment of all kinds of art
in the past. He had his prejudices, the prejudices of
a very wilful man and a working artist. 'What can I
see in Rome,' he said, 'that I cannot see in Whitechapel?'
But he enjoyed the art of most ages and countries more
than he enjoyed his prejudices. He had the historical
sense in art to a very high degree. He knew what the artist
long dead meant by his work as if it were a poem in his
own language, and from the art of the past which he loved
he saw what was wrong with the art of our time. So did
Ruskin and so do many now. Further we are not in the
least content to admire the art of the past without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
producing any of our own. There is incessant restless
experiment, incessant speculation about aesthetics, incessant
effort to apply them to the actual production of
art, in fact to exert the conscious human will upon art
as it has never been exerted before.</p>

<p>So, if one wished in a sentence to state the peculiarity
of the last century in the history of art, one would say
that it is the first age in which men have rebelled against
the process of decadence in art, in which they have been
completely conscious of that process and have tried to
arrest it by a common effort of will. We cannot yet say
that that effort has succeeded, but we cannot say either
that it has failed. We may be discontented with the art
of our own time, but at least we must allow that it is, with
all its faults, extravagances, morbidities and blind experiments,
utterly unlike the art of any former age of decadence
known to us. There may be confusion and anarchy,
but there is not mere pedantry and stagnation. Artists
perhaps are over-conscious, always following some new
prophet, but at least there is the conviction of sin in them,
which is exactly what all the decadent artists of the past
have lacked.</p>

<p>The artistic decadence of the past which is most
familiar to us is that of the later Graeco-Roman art.
It was a long process which began at least as early as the
age of Alexander and continued until the fall of the
Western Roman Empire and afterwards, until, indeed,
the decadent classical art was utterly supplanted by the
art which we call Romanesque and Byzantine, and which
seems to us now at its best to be as great as any art that
has ever been.</p>

<p>But a hundred years ago this Romanesque and Byzantine
art was thought to be only a barbarous corruption
of the classical art. For then the classical art even in
its last feebleness still kept its immense and unique<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
prestige. Shelley said that the effect of Christianity
seemed to have been to destroy the last remains of pure
taste, and he said this when he had been looking at the
great masterpieces of Byzantine mosaic at Ravenna.
Now we know with an utter certainty that he was wrong.
He was himself a great artist, but to him there was only
one rational and beautiful and civilized art, and that was
the decadent Graeco-Roman art. To him works like the
Apollo Belvedere were the masterpieces of the world, and
all other art was good as it resembled them. He and in
fact most people of his time were still overawed by the
immense complacency of that art. They had not the
historical sense at all. They had no notion of certain
psychological facts about art which are now familiar to
every educated man. They did not know that art cannot
be good unless it expresses the character of the people
who produce it; that characterless art, however accomplished,
is uninteresting; that there may be more life and
so more beauty in the idol of an African savage than in
the Laocoon.</p>

<p>This later Greek and Graeco-Roman art was doomed
to inevitable decay because of its immense complacency.
The artists had discovered, as they thought, the right
way to produce works of art, and they went on producing
them in that way without asking themselves whether
they meant anything by them or whether they enjoyed
them. They knew, in fact, what was the proper thing
to do just as conventional people now know what is the
proper thing to talk about at a tea party; and their art
was as uninteresting as the conversation of such people.
In both the talk and the art there is no expression of real
values and so no expression of real will. The past lies
heavy upon both. So people have talked, so artists have
worked, and so evidently people must talk and artists
must work for evermore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we have been threatened with just the same kind
of artistic decadence, and we are still threatened with it;
so that it would be very easy to argue that, when men
reach a certain stage in that organization of their lives
which we call civilization, they must inevitably fall into
artistic decadence. The Roman Empire did attain to
a high stage of such organization, and all the life went
out of its art. We have reached perhaps a still higher or
at least more elaborate stage of it, and the life has gone
or is going out of our art. It has become even more
mechanical than the Graeco-Roman. We, too, have lost
the power of expressing ourselves, our real values, our
real will, in it; and we had better submit to that impotence
and not make a fuss about it. Indeed art really is
an activity proper to a more childish stage of the human
mind, and we shall do well not to waste our time and
energy upon it. That is the only way in which we can be
superior to the Graeco-Roman world in the matter of art.
We can give it up altogether or rather put it all into
museums as a curiosity of the past to be studied for
historical and scientific purposes.</p>

<p>But I have only to say that to prove that we will not
be contented with such a counsel of despair. The Romans
went on producing art, even if it was bad art, and we
shall certainly go on producing art whether it is good or
bad. We have produced an immense mass of bad art,
worse perhaps than any that the Roman world produced.
But there is this difference between us and the Romans,
that we are not content with it. We have the conviction
of artistic sin and they had not. Therefore we do not
think that their example need make us despair. They
were not exercising their will on their art. It was to
them what a purely conventional morality is to a morally
decadent people. It went from bad to worse, just as
conventional morals do, when no man arises and says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
'This is wrong, although you think it right. I know what
is right from my own sense of values, and I will do it in
spite of you.' So far as we know, there were no rebels
of that kind in the art of the Graeco-Roman world. But
our world of art is full of such rebels and has been ever
since the artistic debacle at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. In fact the chief and the unique characteristic
of the art of the last hundred years has been the
constant succession of artistic rebels. All our greatest
artists have been men who were determined to exercise
their own wills in their art, whatever the mass of men
might think of it. And what has always happened is that
they have been first bitterly abused and then passionately
praised. This, so far as I know, has never happened
before. There have been rebel artists like Rembrandt,
but only a few of them. Most great artists before the
nineteenth century have been admired in their own time.
But in the nineteenth century, and more and more
towards the end of it, the great artists have had to
conquer the world with their rebellion, they have had to
exercise their own individual wills against the common
convention. And it seems to us now the mark of the
great artist so to exercise his individual will, so to rebel
and conquer the world with his rebellion, even if he kills
himself in the process. Think of Constable and even
Turner, of our pre-Raphaelites, and above all of nearly
all the great French artists, of Millet, of Manet, of
Cezanne, Gauguin, of Rodin himself, who has conquered
the world now, but only in his old age. Think of Beethoven,
of Schubert, of Wagner, and of all the rebel
musicians of to-day. But in the past the great artists,
Michelangelo, Titian, even the great innovator Giorgione;
Mozart, Bach, Handel; none of these were thought of as
rebels. They had not to conquer the world against its
will. They came into the world, and the world knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
them. So, we may be sure, the decadent artists of the
Graeco-Roman world were not rebels. There they were
like Michelangelo and Raphael, if they were like them in
nothing else. If they had been rebels we might not yawn
at their works now.</p>

<p>Now, clearly, this rebellion is not so good a thing as the
harmony between the artist and his public which has
prevailed in all great ages of art. But it is better than
the harmony of dull and complacent convention which
prevailed in the Graeco-Roman decadence. For it means
that our artists are not content with such complacence,
that they will not accept decadence as an inevitable
process. And the fact that we do passionately admire
them for their rebellion as soon as we understand what
it means, that this rebellion seems to us a glorious and
heroic thing, is a proof that we, the public, also are not
content to sink into the Graeco-Roman complacency.
We may stone our prophets at first, but like the Hebrews,
we produce prophets as well as priests, that is to say
academicians. And we treasure their works as the
Hebrews treasured the books of the prophets.</p>

<p>Art, in fact, is a human activity in which we try to
exercise our wills. We are aware that it is threatened
with decadence by the mere process of our civilization,
that it is much more difficult for us to produce living art
than it was for our forefathers of the Middle Ages. But
still we are not content to produce dead art. Half
unconsciously we are making the effort to exercise our
wills upon our art, as upon our science, our morals, our
politics, to avoid decadence in art as we try to avoid it
in other human activities; and this effort is the great
experiment, the peculiar feature, of the art of the last
century.</p>

<p>It is an effort not merely aesthetic but also intellectual.
There is a great interest in aesthetics and a constant and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
growing effort to charge them with actual experience
and to put them to some practical end. In the past they
have been the most backward, the most futile and barren,
kind of philosophy because men wrote about them who
had never really experienced works of art and who saw
no connexion between their philosophy and the production
of works of art. They talked about the nature of the
beautiful, as schoolmen talked about the nature of God.
And they knew no more about the nature of the beautiful
from their own experience of it than schoolmen knew
about the nature of God. But now men are interested
in the beautiful because they miss it so much in the
present works of men and because they so passionately
desire it; and their speculation has the aim of recovering
it. So aesthetics, whatever some artists in their peculiar
and pontifical narrowness may say, is of great importance
now; they are part of the effort which the modern
world is making to exercise its will in the production of
works of art, and they are bound, if that effort is
successful, to have more and more effect upon that
production.</p>

<p>But is that effort going to be successful? That is
a question which no one can answer yet. But my object
is to insist that in our age, because of its effort, an effort
which has never been made so consciously and resolutely
before, there is a possibility of a progress in art of the
same nature as progress in other human activities. If
we can escape from what has seemed to some men this
inexorable process of decadence in art, we shall have
accomplished one of the greatest achievements of the
human will. We shall have redeemed art from the
tyranny of mere fate.</p>

<p>What we have to do now is to understand what it is that
causes decadence in art, we have to apply a conscious
science to the production of it. We have to see what are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the social causes that produce excellence and decay in it.
And we have made a great beginning in this. For we are
all aware that art is not an isolated thing, that it does not
merely happen, as Whistler said. We know that it is
a symptom of something right or wrong with the whole
mind of man and with the circumstances that affect that
mind. We know at last that there is a connexion between
the art of man and his intellect and his conscience. It
was because William Morris saw that connexion that he,
from being a pure artist, became a socialist and spoke
at street corners. Such a change, such a waste and
perversion as it seemed to many, would have been
impossible in any former age. It was possible and inevitable,
it was a natural process for Morris in the nineteenth
century, because he was determined to exercise his will
upon art, just as men in the past had exercised their will
upon religion or politics; because he no longer believed
that art happened as the weather happens and that the
artist is a charming but irresponsible child swayed
merely by the caprices of his own private subconsciousness.
Was he right or wrong? I myself firmly believe
that he was right. That if man has a will at all, if he is
not a mere piece of matter moulded by circumstances,
he has a will in art as in all other things. And, further,
if he has a common will which can express itself in his
other activities, in religion or politics, that common will
must also be able to express itself in art. It has not
hitherto done so consciously, because man in all periods
of artistic success has been content to succeed without
asking why he succeeded, and in all periods of artistic
failure he has been content to fail without asking why
he has failed. We have been for long living in a period
of artistic failure, but we have asked, we are asking
always more insistently, why we fail. And that is where
our time differs from any former period of artistic deca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>dence,
why, I believe, it is not a period of decadence but
one of experiment, and of experiment which will not be
wasted, however much it may seem at the moment to
fail. But if out of all this conscious effort and experiment
we do arrest the process of decadence, if we do pass from
failure to success, then we shall have accomplished a progress
in art such as has never been accomplished before
even in the greatest ages. For whereas men have never
been able to learn from the experience of those ages,
whereas the Greeks and the men of the thirteenth century
have not taught men how to avoid decadence in art, we
and our children will teach them how to avoid it. We
shall then have given a security to art such as it has
never enjoyed before; and we shall do that by applying
science to it, by using the conscious intelligence
upon it.</p>

<p>We may fail, of course, but even so our effort will not
have been in vain. And some future age in happier
circumstances may profit by it, and achieve that progress,
that application of science to art, which we are now
attempting.</p>

<p>Many people, especially artists, tell us that the attempt
is a mere absurdity. But ignorance even about art need
not be eternal. Ignorance is eternal only when it is
despairing or contented. Twenty years ago many people
said that men never would be able to fly, yet they are
flying now because they were resolved to fly. So we are
more and more resolved to have great art. Every year
we feel the lack of it more and more. Every year more
people exercise their wills more and more consciously in
the effort to achieve it. This, I repeat, has never happened
before in the history of the world. And the consequence
is that our art, what real art we have, is unlike any that
there has been in the world before. It is so strange and
so rebellious that we ourselves are shocked and amazed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
by it. Much of it, no doubt, is merely strange and
rebellious, as much of early Christianity was merely
strange and rebellious and so provoked the resentment
and persecution of self-respecting pagans. Every great
effort of the human mind attracts those who merely
desire their own salvation, and so it is with the artistic
effort now. There are cubists and futurists and post-impressionists
who are as silly as human beings can be,
because they hope to attain to artistic salvation by
rushing to extremes. They are religious egotists, in fact,
and nothing can be more disagreeable than a religious
egotist. But there were no doubt many of them among
the early Christians. Yet Christianity was a great creative
religious effort which came because life and truth had
died out of the religions of the past, and men could not
endure to live without life and truth in their religion.
So now they cannot endure to live without life and truth
in their art. They are determined to have an art which
shall express all that they have themselves experienced
of the beauty of the universe, which shall not merely
utter platitudes of the past about that beauty.</p>

<p>So far perhaps there is little but the effort at expression,
an effort strange, contorted, self-conscious. You can
say your worst about it and laugh at all its failures. Yet
they are failures different in kind from the artistic failures
of the past, for they are failures of the conscious will, not
of mere complacency. And it is such failures in all human
activities that prepare the way for successes.</p>

<p>Let us remember then, always, that art is a human
activity, not a fairy chance that happens to the mind of
man now and again. And let us remember, too, that it
does not consist merely of pictures or statues or of music
performed in concert-rooms. It is, indeed, rather a quality
of all things made by man, a quality that may be good
or bad but which is always in them. That is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
facts about art that was discovered in the nineteenth
century, when men began to miss the excellence of art in
all their works and to wish passionately that its excellence
might return to them. And this discovery which was
then made about art was of the greatest practical importance.
For then men became aware that they could not
have good pictures or architecture or sculpture unless
the quality of art became good again in all their works.
So much they learnt about the science of art. They
began, or some of them did, to think about their furniture
and cottages and pots and pans and spoons and forks,
and even about their tombstones, as well as about what
had been called their works of art. And in all these
humbler things an advance, a conscious resolute wilful
advance, has been made. We begin to see when and also
why spoons and forks and pots and pans are good or bad.
We are less at the mercy of chance or blind fashion in
such things than our fathers were. We know our vulgarity
and the naughtiness of our own hearts. The advance,
the self-knowledge, is not general yet, but it grows more
general every year and the conviction of sin spreads.
No doubt, like all conviction of sin, it often produces
unpleasant results. The consciously artistic person often
has a more irritating house than his innocently philistine
grandfather had. So, no doubt, many simple pagan
people were much nicer than those early Christians who
were out for their own salvation. But there was progress
in Christianity and there was none in paganism.</p>

<p>The title of this book is <i>Progress and History</i>, and it
may justly be complained that the progress of which
I have been talking is not historic, but a progress that
has not yet happened and may never happen at all. But
that I think is a defect of my particular branch of the
subject. Progress in art, if progress is anything more
than a natural process of growth to be followed inevitably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
by a natural process of decay, has never yet happened in
art; but there is now an effort to make it happen, an
effort to exercise the human will in art more completely
and consciously than it has ever been exercised before.
Therefore I could do nothing but attempt to describe
that effort and to speculate upon its success.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN SCIENCE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">F.S. Marvin</span></h3>

<p class='center'>'L'Esprit travaillant sur les donn&eacute;es de l'exp&eacute;rience.'</p>


<p>The French phrase, neater as usual than our own, may
be taken as the starting-point in our discussion. We shall
put aside such questions as what an experience is, or how
much the mind itself supplies in each experience, or what,
if anything, is the not-mind upon which the mind works.
We must leave something for the chapter on philosophy;
and the present chapter is primarily historical. Having
defined what we mean by science, we are to consider
at what stage in history the working of the mind on
experience can be called scientific, in what great strides
science has leapt forward since its definite formation, and
in what ways this growth of science has affected general
progress, both by its action on the individual and on the
welfare and unity of mankind.</p>

<p>Our French motto must be qualified in order to give
us precision in our definition and a starting-point in
history for science in the strict sense. In a general sense
the action of the mind upon the given in experience has
been going on from the beginning of animal life. But
science, strictly so-called, does not appear till men have
been civilized and settled in large communities for
a considerable time. We cannot ascribe 'science' to the
isolated savage gnawing bones in his cave, though the
germs are there, in every observation that he makes of
the world around him and every word that he utters to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his mates. But we may begin to speak of science when we
reach those large and ordered societies which are found
in the great river-basins and sedentary civilizations of
East and West, especially in Egypt and Chaldea.</p>

<p>When we turn to the quality of the thing itself, we note
in the first place that while science may be said to begin
with mere description, it implies from the first a certain
degree of order and accuracy, and this order and accuracy
increase steadily as science advances. It is thus a type of
progress, for it is a constant growth in the fullness, accuracy
and simplification of our experience. From the dawn
of science, therefore, man must have acquired standards
and instruments of measurement and means of handing
on his observations to others. Thus writing must have
been invented. But in the second place, there is always
involved in this orderly description, so far as it is scientific,
the element of prediction. The particular description is
not scientific. 'I saw a bird fly' is not a scientific description,
however accurate; but 'The bird flies by stretching
out its wings' is. It contains that causal connexion or
element of generality which enables us to predict.</p>

<p>Before entering on a historical sketch of the most perfect
example of human progress, it is of the first importance
to realize its social foundation. This is the key-note, and
it connects science throughout with the other aspects
of our subject. Knowledge depends upon the free intercourse
of mind with mind, and man advances with the
increase and better direction of his knowledge. But when
we consider the implications of any generalization which we
can call 'a law of nature' the social co-operation involved
becomes still more apparent. Geometry and astronomy&mdash;the
measurement of the earth and the measurement of
the heavens&mdash;dispute the honour of the first place in the
historical order. Both, of course, involved the still more
fundamental conception of number and the acceptance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of some unit for measurement. Now in each case and
at every step a long previous elaboration is implied of
intellectual conventions and agreements&mdash;conscious and
unconscious&mdash;between many minds stretching back to
the beginnings of conscious life: the simplest element of
thought involves the co-operation of individual minds
in a common product. Language is such a common
product of social life and it prepares the ground for
science. But science, as the exact formulation of
general truths, attains a higher degree of social value,
because it rises above the idioms of person or race
and is universally acceptable in form and essence.
Such is the intrinsic nature of the process, and the
historical circumstances of its beginnings make it clear.
It was the quick mind of the Greek which acted as the
spark to fire the trains of thought and observation which
had been accumulating for ages through the agency of
the priests in Egypt and Babylonia. The Greeks lived
and travelled between the two centres, and their earliest
sages and philosophers were men of the most varied intercourse
and occupation. Their genius was fed by a wide
sympathy and an all-embracing curiosity. No other
people could have demonstrated so well the social nature
of science from its inception, and they were planting in
a soil well prepared. In Egypt conspicuously and in
Chaldea also to a less extent there had been a social order
which before the convulsions of the last millennium <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
had lasted substantially unchanged for scores of centuries.
This order was based upon a religious discipline which
connected the sovereigns on earth with the divine power
ruling men from the sky. Hence the supreme importance
of the priesthood and their study of the movements of
the heavenly bodies. The calendar, which they were the
first to frame, was thus not only or even primarily a work
of practical utility but of religious meaning and obligation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
The priests had to fix in advance the feast days of gods and
kings by astronomical prediction. Their standards and
their means of measurement were rough approximations.
Thus the 360 degrees into which the Babylonians taught
us to divide the circle are thought to have been the nearest
round number to the days of the year. The same men
were also capable of the more accurate discovery that
the side of a hexagon inscribed in a circle was equal
to the radius and gave us our division of sixty minutes
and sixty seconds with all its advantages for calculation.
In Egypt, if the surveyors were unaware of the
true relation between a triangle and the rectangle on
the same base, they had yet established the carpenter's
rule of 3, 4 and 5 for the sides of a right-angled
triangle.</p>

<p>How much the Greeks drew from the ancient priesthoods
we shall never know, nor how far the priests had
advanced in those theories of general relations which we
call scientific. But one or two general conclusions as
to this initial stage of scientific preparation may well be
drawn.</p>

<p>One is that a certain degree of settlement and civilization
was necessary for the birth of science. This we find
in these great theocracies, where sufficient wealth enabled
a class of leisured and honoured men to devote themselves
to joint labour in observing nature and recording their
observations. Another point is clear, namely, that the
results of these early observations, crude as they were,
contributed powerfully to give stability to the societies
in which they arose. The younger Pliny points out later
the calming effect of Greek astronomy on the minds of
the Eastern peoples, and we are bound to carry back the
same idea into the ancient settled communities where
astronomy began and where so remarkable an order
prevailed for so long during its preparation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>But however great the value we allow to the observations
of the priests, it is to the Ionian Greeks that we
owe the definite foundation of science in the proper sense;
it was they who gave the raw material the needed accuracy
and generality of application, A comparison of the
societies in the nearer East to which we have referred, with
the history of China affords the strongest presumption of
this. In the later millenniums <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Chinese were in
many points ahead of the Babylonians and Egyptians.
They had made earlier predictions of eclipses and more
accurate observations of the distance of the sun from the
zenith at various places. They had, too, seen the advantages
of a decimal system both in weights and measures
and in the calculations of time. But no Greek genius came
to build the house with the bricks that they had fashioned,
and in spite of the achievements of the Chinese they remained
until our own day the type in the world of a settled
and contented, although unprogressive, conservatism.</p>

<p>Science then among its other qualities contains a force
of social movement, and our age of rapid transformation
has begun to do fuller justice to the work of the Greeks,
the greatest source of intellectual life and change in the
world. We are now fully conscious of the defects in their
methods, the guesses which pass for observations, the
metaphysical notions which often take the place of
experimental results.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But having witnessed the latest
strides in the unification of science on mathematical
lines, we are more and more inclined to prize the geometry
and astronomy of the Greeks, who gave us the first
constructions on which the modern mechanical theories
of the universe are based. We shall quote from them
here only sufficient illustrations to explain and justify
this statement.</p>

<p>The first shall be what is called Euclidean geometry, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
which is in the main the work of the Pythagorean school
of thinkers and social reformers who flourished from the
seventh to the fifth centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> This formed the greater
part of the geometrical truth known to mankind until
Descartes and the mathematicians recommenced the work
in the seventeenth century. The second greatest contribution
of the Greeks was the statics and the conics of which
Archimedes was the chief creator in the third century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> In his work he gave the first sketch of an infinitesimal
calculus and in his own way performed an integration.
The third invaluable construction was the trigonometry
by which Hipparchus for the first time made a scientific
astronomy possible. The fourth, the optics of Ptolemy
based on much true observation and containing an
approximation to the general law.</p>

<p>These are a few outstanding landmarks, peaks in the
highlands of Greek science, and nothing has been said
of their zoology or medicine. In all these cases it will
be seen that the advance consisted in bringing varying
instances under the same rule, in seeing unity in difference,
in discovering the true link which held together the various
elements in the complex of phenomena. That the Greek
mind was apt in doing this is cognate to their idealizing
turn in art. In their statues they show us the universal
elements in human beauty; in their science, the
true relations that are common to all triangles and all
cones.</p>

<p>Ptolemy's work in optics is a good example of the
scientific mind at work.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The problem is the general
relation which holds between the angles of incidence and
of refraction when a ray passes from air into water or
from air into glass. He groups a series of the angles with
a close approximation to the truth, but just misses the
perception which would have turned his excellent raw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
material into the finished product of science. His brick
does not quite fit its place in the building. His formula
<i>i</i> (the angle of incidence) = <i>nr</i> (the angle of refraction) only
fits the case of very small angles for which the sine is
negligible, though it had the deceptive advantage of
including reflexion as one case of refraction. He did not
pursue the argument and make his form completely
general. Sin <i>i</i> = <i>n</i> sin <i>r</i> escaped him, though he had
all the trigonometry of Hipparchus behind him, and it
was left for Snell and Descartes to take the simple
but crucial step at the beginning of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The case is interesting for more than one reason. It
shows us what is a general form, or law of nature in
mathematical shape, and it also illustrates the progress of
science as it advances from the most abstract conceptions
of number and geometry, to more concrete phenomena
such as physics. The formula for refraction which
Ptolemy helped to shape, is geometrical in form. With
him, as with the discoverer of the right angle in a semicircle,
the mind was working to find a general ideal
statement under which all similar occurrences might be
grouped. Observation, the collection of similar instances,
measurement, are all involved, and the general statement,
law or form, when arrived at, is found to link up
other general truths and is then used as a starting-point
in dealing with similar cases in future. Progress in
science consists in extending this mental process to an
ever-increasing area of human experience. We shall see,
as we go on, how in the concrete sciences the growing
complexity and change of detail make such generalizations
more and more difficult. The laws of pure geometry
seem to have more inherent necessity and the
observations on which they were originally founded have
passed into the very texture of our minds. But the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of building up, or, perhaps better, of organizing our
experience remains fundamentally the same. Man is
throughout both perceiving and making that structure of
truth which is the framework of progress.</p>

<p>Ptolemy's work brings us to the edge of the great
break which occurred in the growth of science between
the Greek and the modern world. In the interval, the
period known as the Middle Ages, the leading minds in
the leading section of the human race were engaged in
another part of the great task of human improvement.
For them the most incumbent task was that of developing
the spiritual consciousness of men for which the Catholic
Church provided an incomparable organization. But the
interval was not entirely blank on the scientific side.
Our system of arithmetical notation, including that
invaluable item the cipher, took shape during the Middle
Ages at the hands of the Arabs, who appear to have derived
it in the main from India. Its value to science is an
excellent object-lesson on the importance of the details of
form. Had the Greeks possessed it, who can say how
far they might have gone in their applications of
mathematics?</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this drawback the most permanent contribution
of the Greeks to science was in the very sphere
of exact measurement where they would have received the
most assistance from a better system of calculation had
they possessed it. They founded and largely constructed
both plane and spherical geometry on the lines which best
suit our practical intelligence. They gave mankind the
framework of astronomy by determining the relative
positions of the heavenly bodies, and they perceived and
correctly stated the elementary principles of equilibrium.
At all these points the immortal group of men who
adopted the Copernican theory at the Renascence, began
again where the Greeks had left off. But modern science<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
starts with two capital improvements on the work of
the Greeks. Measurement there had been from the first,
and the effort to find the constant thing in the variable
flux; and from the earliest days of the Ionian sages
the scientific mind had been endeavouring to frame the
simplest general hypothesis or form which would contain
all the facts. But the moderns advanced decisively, in
method, by experimenting and verifying their hypotheses,
and in subject-matter, by applying their method to phenomena
of movement, which may theoretically include all
facts biological as well as physical. Galileo, the greatest
founder of modern science, perfectly exemplifies both
these new departures.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, the most instructive and encouraging
thing in the whole annals of progress to note how the men
of the Renascence were able to pick up the threads of
the Greeks and continue their work. The texture held
good. Leonardo da Vinci, whose birth coincides with
the invention of the printing-press, is the most perfect
reproduction in modern times of the early Greek sophos,
the man of universal interests and capacity. He gave
careful and admiring study to Archimedes, the greatest
pure man of science among the Greeks, the one man
among them whose works, including even his letters,
have come down to us practically complete. A little later,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, Copernicus
gained from the Pythagoreans the crude notion of the
earth's movement round a great central fire, and from
it he elaborated the theory which was to revolutionize
thought. Another half-century later the works of
Archimedes were translated into Latin and for the first
time printed. They thus became well known before the
time of Galileo, who also carefully studied them. At the
beginning of the seventeenth century Galileo made the
capital discoveries which established both the Copernican<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
theory and the science of dynamics. Galileo's death in
1642 coincides with the birth of Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>Such is the sequence of the most influential names at
the turning-point of modern thought.</p>

<p>Galileo's work, his experiments with falling bodies and
the revelations of his telescope, carried the strategic
lines of Greek science across the frontiers of a New World,
and Newton laid down the lines of permanent occupation
and organized the conquest. Organization, the formation
of a network of lines connected as a whole, and giving
access to different parts of the world of experience, is
perhaps the best image of the growth of science in the
mind of mankind. It will be seen that it does not
imply any exhaustion of the field, nor any identification
of all knowledge with exact or systematic knowledge. The
process is rather one of gradual penetration, the linking
up and extension of the area of knowledge by well-defined
and connected methods of thought. No all-embracing
plan thought out beforehand by the first founders of
science, or any of their successors, can be applied systematically
to the whole range of our experience. It has not
been so in the past; still less does it seem possible in the
future. For the most part the discoverer works on steadily
in his own plot, occupying the nearest places first, and
observing here and there that one of his lines runs into
some one else's. Every now and then a greater and more
comprehensive mind appears, able to treat several systems
as one whole, to survey a larger area and extend that
empire of the mind which, as Bacon tells us, is nobler
than any other.</p>

<p>Of such conquerors Newton was the greatest we have
yet known, because he brought together into one system
more and further-reaching lines of communication than
any one else. He unified the forms of measurement
which had previously been treated as the separate subjects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of geometry, astronomy, and the newly-born science of
dynamics. Celestial mechanics embraces all three, and is
a fresh and decisive proof of the commanding influence
of the heavenly bodies on human life and thought. Not
by a horoscope, but by continued and systematic thought,
humanity was unravelling its nature and destiny in the
stars as well as in itself. These are the two approaches to
perfect knowledge which are converging more and more
closely in our own time. Newton's work was the longest
step yet taken on the mechanical side, and we must
complete our notice of it by the briefest possible reference
to the later workers on the same line, before turning to
the sciences of life which began their more systematic
evolution with the discovery of Harvey, a contemporary
of Newton.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century, with Descartes' application
of algebra to geometry, and Newton's and Leibnitz's
invention of the differential and integral calculus, improved
our methods of calculation to such a point that
summary methods of vastly greater comprehensiveness
and elasticity can be applied to any problem of which
the elements can be measured. The mere improvement
in the method of describing the same things (cf. e.g.
a geometrical problem as written down by Archimedes
with any modern treatise) was in itself a revolution.
But the new calculus went much farther. It enabled us
to represent, in symbols which may be dealt with arithmetically,
any form of regular movement.</p>

<p>As movement is universal, and the most obvious
external manifestation of life itself, the hopes of a mathematical
treatment of all phenomena are indefinitely
enlarged, for all fresh laws or forms might conceivably
be expressed as differential equations. So to the vision
of a Poincar&eacute; the human power of prediction appears
to have no assignable theoretical limit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The seventeenth century which witnessed this momentous
extension of mathematical methods, also contains
the cognate foundation of scientific physics. Accurate
measurement began to be applied to the phenomena
of light and heat, the expansion of gases, the various
changes in the forms of matter apart from life. The
eighteenth century which continued this work, is also and
most notably marked by the establishment of a scientific
chemistry. In this again we see a further extension of
accurate measurement: another order of things different
in quality began to be treated by a quantitative analysis.
Lavoisier's is the greatest name. He gave a clear and
logical classification of the chemical elements then known,
which served as useful a purpose in that science, as
classificatory systems in botany and zoology have done
in those cases. But the crucial step which established
chemistry, a step also due to Lavoisier, was making the
test of weight decisive. 'The balance was the <i>ultima ratio</i>
of his laboratory.' His first principle was that the total
weight of all the products of a chemical process must be
exactly equal to the total weight of the substances used.
From this, and rightly disregarding the supposed weight
of heat, he could proceed to the discovery of the accurate
proportions of the elements in all the compounds he was
able to analyse.</p>

<p>Since then the process of mathematical synthesis in
science has been carried many stages further. The exponents
of this aspect of scientific progress, of whom we may
take the late M. Henri Poincar&eacute; as the leading representative
in our generation, are perfectly justified in treating
this gradual mathematical unification of knowledge with
pride and confidence. They have solid achievement on
their side. It is through science of this kind that the
idea of universal order has gained its sway in man's
mind. The occasional attacks on scientific method, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
talk one sometimes hears of 'breaking the fetters of
Cartesian mechanics', seem to suggest that the great
structure which Galileo, Newton, and Descartes founded
is comparable to the false Aristotelianism which they
destroyed. The suggestion is absurd: its chief excuse is
the desire to defend the autonomy of the sciences of
life, about which we have a word to say later on. But
we must first complete our brief mention of the greatest
stages on the mechanical side, of which a full and vivid
account may be found in such a book as M. Poincar&eacute;'s
<i>Science et Hypoth&egrave;se</i>.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century a trio of discoverers,
a Frenchman, a German, and an Englishman, established
the theory of the conservation of energy. To the labours
of Sadi Carnot, Mayer, and Joule is due our knowledge of
the fact that heat which, as a supposed entity, had disturbed
the physics and chemistry of the earlier centuries,
was itself another form of mechanical energy and could
be measured like the rest. Later in the century another
capital step in synthesis was taken by the foundation
of astrophysics, which rests on the identity of the physics
and chemistry of the heavenly bodies with those of the
earth.</p>

<p>The known universe thus becomes still more one. Later
researches again, especially those of Maxwell, tend to
the identification of light and heat with electricity, and
in the last stage matter as a whole seems to be swallowed
up in motion. It is found that similar equations will
express all kinds of motion; that all are really various
forms of the motion of something which the mind
postulates as the thing in motion; we have in each
case to deal with wave-movements of different length.
The broad change, therefore, which has taken place since
the mechanics of Newton is the advance from the consideration
of masses to that of molecules of smaller and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
smaller size, and the truth of the former is not thereby
invalidated. Newton, Descartes, Fresnel, Carnot, Joule,
Mayer, Faraday, Helmholtz, Maxwell appear as one great
succession of unifiers. All have been engaged in the same
work of consolidating thought at the same time that they
extended it. Their conceptions of force, mass, matter,
ether, atom, molecule have provisional validity as the
imagined objective substratum of our experience, and
the fact that we analyse these conceptions still further
and sometimes discard them, does not in any way invalidate
the law or general form in which they have enabled
us to sum up our experience and predict the future.</p>

<p>But now we turn to the other side. In spite of the
continued progress noted on the mechanical side, it is
true that the predominant scientific interest changed in
the nineteenth century from mechanics to biology, from
matter to life, from Newton to Darwin. Darwin was born
in 1809, the year in which Lamarck, who invented the
term biology, published his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>. The
<i>Origin of Species</i> appeared in 1858 after the conservation
of energy had been established, and the range and influence
of evolutionary biology have grown ever since.</p>

<p>Before anything can be said of the conclusions in this
branch of science one preliminary remark has to be made.
From the philosophical point of view the science of life
includes all other, for man is a living animal, and science
is the work of his co-operating mind, one of the functions
of his living activity. What this involves on the philosophical
side does not concern us here, but it is necessary
to indicate here the nature of the contact between
the two great divisions of science, the mechanical and
the biological, considered purely as sciences. For, though
we know that our consciousness as a function of life
must in some form come into the science of life, and
is, in a sense, above it all, we are yet able to draw con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>clusions,
apparently of infinite scope, about the behaviour
of all living things around us and including ourselves,
just as we do about a stone or a star. And we are interested
in this chapter in seeing how this drawing of
general conclusions keeps growing with regard to the
phenomena of life, just as it has grown with regard to all
other phenomena, and we have to consider what sort of
difference there is between the one class of generalizations
and the other.</p>

<p>For those of us who are content to rest their conclusions
on the positively known, who, while not setting any limits
to the possible extension of knowledge, are not prepared
to dogmatize about it, it is still necessary to draw a line.
A dualism remains, name and fact alike abhorrent to
the completely logical philosophic mind. On the one
hand the ordinary laws of physical science are constantly
extending their sphere; on the other, the fact of life still
remains unexplained by them, and becomes in itself more
and more marvellous as we investigate it. The general
position remains much as Johannes M&uuml;ller expressed it
about the middle of the last century, himself sometimes
described as the central figure in the history of modern
physiology. 'Though there appears to be something
in the phenomena of living beings which cannot be explained
by ordinary mechanical, physical, or chemical
laws, much may be so explained, and we may without
fear push these explanations as far as we can, so long as we
keep to the solid ground of observation and experiment.'
Since this was written the double process has gone on
apace. The chemistry and physics of living matter are
being sketched, and biologists are more and more inclined
to study the mechanical expression of the facts of life.
Mr. Bateson, for instance, tells us that the greatest advance
that we can foresee will be made 'when it is possible to
connect the geometrical phenomena of development with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the chemical'. The process of applying physical laws to
life follows, it would seem, the reverse order of their
original development. First the chemistry of organic
matter was investigated, then the physical attraction of
their molecules, and now their geometry is in question.
So, says Professor Bateson, the 'geometrical symmetry of
living things is the key to a knowledge of their regularity
and the forces which cause it. In the symmetry of the
dividing cell the basis of that resemblance which we call
Heredity is contained'.</p>

<p>But such work as this is still largely speculative and in
the future. It does not solve the secret of life. It does
not affect the fact of consciousness which we are free to
conceive, if we will, as the other side of what we call
matter, evolving with it from the most rudimentary
forms into the highest known form in man, or still further
into some super-personal or universal form. This,
however, is philosophy or metaphysics. We are here
concerned with the progress of science, in one of its two
great departments, i.e. knowledge about life and all
its known manifestations, which from Aristotle onwards
have been subjected to a scrutiny similar to that which
has been given to the physical facts of the universe and
with results in many points similar also. But the facts,
although superficially more familiar, are infinitely more
complicated, and the scrutiny has only commenced in
earnest some hundred years ago. Considering the short
space for this concentrated and systematic study, the
results are at least as wonderful as those achieved by the
physicists. Two or three points of suggestive analogy
between the courses of the two great branches of science
may here be mentioned.</p>

<p>We will put first the fundamental question on which,
as we have seen, no final answer has yet been reached:
What is life, and is there any evidence of life arising from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the non-living? Now this baffling and probably unanswerable
question&mdash;unanswerable, that is, in terms which go
beyond the physical concomitants of life&mdash;has played
the part in biology which the alchemists' quest played
in chemistry. It led by the way to a host of positive
discoveries. Aristotle, the father of biology, believed in
spontaneous generation. He was puzzled by the case of
parasites, especially in putrefying matter. Even Harvey,
who made the first great definite discovery about the
mechanism of the body, agreed with Aristotle in this
error. It was left for the minute and careful inquirers
of the nineteenth century to dispose of the myth. It was
only after centuries of inquiry that the truth was established
that life, as we know it, only arises from life. But
the whole course of the inquiry had illuminated the nature
of life and had brought together facts as to living things
of all kinds, plants and animals, great and small, which
show superficially the widest difference. Illumination by
unification is here the note, as clearly as in the mathematical-physical
sciences. All living things are found
to be built up from cells and each cell to be an organism,
a being, that is, with certain qualities belonging to it as
a whole, which cannot be predicated of any collection
of parts not an organism. The cell is such an organism,
just as the animal is an organism, and among its qualities
as an organism is the power of growth by assimilating
material different from itself. Yet, in spite of this assimilation
and constant change, it grows and decays as one
whole and reproduces its like.</p>

<p>Another point of analogy between the animate and the
inanimate sphere is that the process of study in both has
been from the larger to the smaller elements. The microscope
has played at least as decisive a part as the telescope,
and it dates from about the same time, at the beginning
of the seventeenth century. Since then it has penetrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
farther and farther into the infinitesimal elements of life
and matter, and in each case there seems to be no assignable
limit to our analysis. The cell is broken up into
physiological units to which almost every investigator
gives a new name. We are now confronted by the
fascinating theory of Arrhenius of an infinite universe
filled with vital spores, wafted about by radio-activity,
and beginning their upward course of evolution wherever
they find a kindly soil on which to rest. To such a vision
the hopes and fears of mortal existence, catastrophes of
nature or of society, even the decay of man, seem transient
and trivial, and the infinities embrace.</p>

<p>A third point, perhaps the most important in the comparison,
is the way by which the order of science has entered
into our notions of life, through a great theory, the theory
of evolution or the doctrine of descent. In this we find a
solid basis for the co-ordination of facts: it was the rise
of this theory in the hands of one thinker of unconquerable
patience and love of truth which has put the study of
biology in the pre-eminent position which it now holds.
But it is necessary to consider the evolution theory as
something both older and wider than Darwin's presentation
of it. Darwin's work was to suggest a <i>vera causa</i> for a
process which earlier philosophers had imagined almost
from the beginning of abstract thought. He observed and
collected a multitude of facts which made his explanations
of the change of species&mdash;within their limits&mdash;as convincing
as they are plausible. But the idea that species change, by
slow and regular steps, was an old one, and his particular
explanations, natural and sexual selection, are seen on
further reflection to have only a limited scope.</p>

<p>This is no place, of course, to discuss the details of the
greatest and most vexed question in the whole science
of life. But it belongs to our argument to consider it
from one or two general points of view. Its analogies with,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and its differences from, the great generalizations of
mathematical physics, are both highly instructive. The
first crude hypothesis of the gradual evolution of various
vegetable and animal forms from one another may be
found in the earliest Greek thinkers, just as Pythagoras
and Aristarchus anticipated the Copernican theory.
Aristotle gave the idea a philosophic statement which
only the fuller knowledge of our own time enables us to
appreciate. He traced the gradual progression in nature
from the inorganic to the organic, and among living
things from the simpler to the higher forms. But his
knowledge of the facts was insufficient: the Greeks had
no microscope, and the dissecting knife was forbidden on
the human subject. Then, as these things were gradually
added to science from the seventeenth century onwards,
and the record of the rocks gave the confirmation of
palaeontology, the whole realm of living nature was
gradually unfolded before us, every form connected both
in function and in history with every other, every organ
fulfilling a necessary part, either now or in the past, and
growing and changing to gain a more perfect accord with
its environment. Such is the supreme conception which
now dominates biological science much as the Newtonian
theory has dominated physics for two hundred years;
and it is idle to debate whether this new idea is different
in kind or only in degree from the great law of physics.
It is a general notion or law which brings together and
explains myriads of hitherto unrelated particulars; it
has been established by observation and experiment
working on a previous hypothesis; it involves measurement,
as all accurate observation must, and it gives us
an increasing power of prediction. So far, therefore, we
must class it with the great mathematical laws and
dissent from M. Bergson. But seeing that the multitudinous
facts far surpass our powers of complete colli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>gation,
that much in the vital process is still obscure,
that we are conscious in ourselves of a power of shaping
circumstances which we are inclined in various degrees
to attribute to other living things, so far we recognize
a profound difference between the laws of life and the
laws of physics, and pay our respects to M. Bergson and
his allies of the neo-vitalist school. Not for the first time
in history we have to seek the truth in the reconciliation,
or at least the cohabitation, of apparent contradictories.</p>

<p>To us who are concerned in tracing the progress of
mankind as a whole, and constantly find the roots of
progress in the growth of the social spirit, the development,
that is, of unity of spirit and of action on a wider
and deeper scale, there is one aspect of biological truth,
as the evolutionists have lately revealed it, which is of
special interest. The living thing is an organism of which
the characteristic is the constant effort to preserve its
unity. This is in fact the definition of an organism. It
only dies or suffers diminution in order to reproduce itself,
and the new creature repeats by some sort of organic
memory the same preservative acts that its parents did.
We recognize life by these manifestations. A merely
material, non-living thing, such as a crystal, cannot thus
make good its loss, nor can it assimilate unlike substance
and make it a part of itself. But these things are of the
nature of life. Now mankind, as a whole, has, if our
argument is correct, this characteristic of an organism: it
is bound together by more than mechanical or accidental
links. It is <i>one</i> by the nature of its being, and the study
of mankind, the highest branch of the science of life,
rests, or should rest, upon the basis of those common
functions by which humanity is held together and distinguished
from the rest of the animate world.</p>

<p>Just as in passing from the mechanical sciences to that
of life, we noticed that the general laws of the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sphere still held good, but that new factors not analysable
into those of the former had to be reckoned with, so in
passing from the animate realm, as a whole, to man its
highest member, we find that, while animal, and subject
to the general laws of animality, he adds features which
distinguish him as another order and cannot be found
elsewhere. His unity as an organism has a progressive
quality possessed by no other species. Step by step his
mind advances into the recesses of time and space, and
makes the farthest objects that his mind can reach
a part of his being. His unity of organization, of which
the humblest animalcule is a simple type, goes far beyond
the preservation or even the improvement of his species:
it touches the infinite though it cannot contain it. To
trace this widening process is the true key to progress,
the <i>id&eacute;e-m&egrave;re</i> of history. For while man's evolution has
its practical side, like that of other species,&mdash;the needs
of nutrition, of reproduction, of adapting himself to his
environment,&mdash;with man this is the basis and not the end.
The end is, first the organization of himself as a world-being,
conscious of his unity, and then the illimitable
conquest of truth and goodness as far as his ever-growing
powers extend.</p>

<p>Man's reason is thus, as philosophers have always
taught, his special characteristic, and takes the place for
him, on a higher plane, of the law of organic growth
common to all living things. In this we join hands,
across two thousand years, with Aristotle: he would have
understood us and used almost identical language. But
the content of the words as we use them and their applications
are immeasurably greater.</p>

<p>The content is the mass of knowledge which man's
reason has accumulated and partly put in order since
Aristotle taught. It is now so great that thoroughly to
master a single branch is arduous labour for a lifetime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of concentrated toil, and at the end of it new discoveries
will crowd upon the worker and he will die with all his
earlier notions crying for revision. No case so patent,
so conclusive, of the reality of human unity and the paramount
need of organization. The individual here can
only thrive and only be of service as a small member of
a great whole, one atom in a planet, one cell in a body.
The demand which Comte raised more than fifty years
ago for another class of specialists, the specialists in
generalities, is now being taken up by men of science
themselves. But the field has now so much extended
and is so much fuller in every part, that it would seem
that nothing less than a committee of Aristotles could
survey the whole. And even this is but one aspect of
the matter. Just as the genesis of science was in the
daily needs of men&mdash;the cultivators whose fields must
be re-measured after the flooding, the priests who had
to fix the right hour for sacrifice&mdash;so all through its
history science has grown and in the future will grow
still more by following the suggestions of practice. It
gathers strength by contact with the world and life, and
it should use its strength in making the world more fit
to live in. Thus our committee of scientific philosophers
needs to have constantly in touch with it not one but
many boards of scientific practitioners.</p>

<p>The past which has given us this most wonderful of
all the fruits of time, does not satisfy us equally as to the
use that has been made of it. Our crowded slums do not
proclaim the glory of Watt and Stephenson as the heavens
remind us of Kepler and Newton. Selfishness has grown
fat on ill-paid labour, and jealous nations have sharpened
their weapons with every device that science can suggest.
But a sober judgement, as well as the clearest evidence of
history, dictates a more hopeful conclusion. Industry, the
twin brother of science, has vastly increased our wealth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
our comfort, and our capacity for enjoyment. Medicine,
the most human of her children, has lengthened our lives,
fortified our bodies, and alleviated our suffering. Every
chapter in this volume gives some evidence of the beneficent
power of science. For religion, government, morality,
even art, are all profoundly influenced by the knowledge
that man has acquired of the world around him and his
practical conclusions from it. These do not, with the
possible exception of art, contradict the thesis of a general
improvement of mankind, and science must therefore
claim a share&mdash;it would seem the decisive share&mdash;in the
result. We speak, of course, of science in the sense which
has been developed in this essay, of the bright well-ordered
centre to our knowledge which is always spreading and
bringing more of the surrounding fringe, which is also
spreading, into the well-defined area. In this sense
religion, morality and government have all within
historic times come within the range of clear and well-ordered
thought: and mankind standing thus within
the light, stands more firmly and with better hope. He
sees the dark spots and the weaknesses. He knows the
remedies, though his will is often unequal to applying
them. And even with this revelation of weakness and
ignorance, he is on the whole happier and readier to
grapple with his fate.</p>

<p>If this appears a fair diagnosis of the Western mind in
the midst of its greatest external crisis, the reason for
this amazing firmness of mind and stability of society
must be sought in the structure which science and industry
combined have built around us. The savage, untutored
in astronomy, may think that an eclipse betokens the
end of the world. Science convinces him that it will
pass. Just so the modern world trained to an order of
thought and of society which rests on world-wide activities
elaborated through centuries of common effort, awaits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the issue of our darkened present calmly and unmoved.
The things of the mind on which all nations have co-operated
in the past will re-assert their sway. Fundamentally
this is a triumph for the scientific spirit, the order
which man has now succeeded in establishing between
himself and his surroundings.</p>

<p>The country is demanding&mdash;and rightly&mdash;a stronger
bias in our educational system for teaching of a scientific
kind; but teachers and professors are not unnaturally
perplexed. They see the immeasurable scope of the new
knowledge; they know the labour, often ineffective, that
has been expended in teaching the rudiments of the old
'humanities'. And now a task is propounded to them
before which the old one with all its faults seems definite,
manageable and formative of character. The classical
world which has been the staple of our education for
400 years is a finished thing and we can compass it in
thought. It lives indeed, but unconsciously, in our lives,
as we go about our business. This new world into which
our youth has now to enter, rests also on the past, but it
is still more present; it grows all round us faster than
we can keep pace with its earlier stages. How then can
such a thing be used as an instrument of education where
above all something is needed of clear and definite purpose,
stimulating in itself and tending to mental growth and
activity in after life? We could not, even if we would,
offer any satisfactory answer here to one of the most
troubled questions of the day. Decades of experiments
will be needed before even a tolerable solution can be
reached. But the argument pursued in this and other
essays may suggest a line of approach. This must lie
in a reconciliation between science and history, or rather
in the recognition that science rightly understood is the
key to history, and that the history best worth study is the
record of man's collective thought in face of the infinite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
complexities, the barriers and byways, the lights and
shadows of life and nature. From the study of man's
approach to knowledge and unity in history each new-coming
student may shape his own. He sees a unity of
thought not wholly unattainable, a foundation laid
beneath the storms of time. To a mind thus trained
should come an eagerness to carry on the conquests of the
past and to apply the lessons gained to the amelioration
of the present.</p>

<p>This we may hope from the well-disposed. But for
all, the contemplation of a universe where man's mind has
worked for ages in unravelling its secrets and describing
its wonders, must bring a sense of reverence as well as
trust. It is no dry category of abstract truths to which
we turn and would have others turn, but a world as
bright and splendid as the rainbow to the savage or the
forest to the poet or the heavens to the lonely watcher on
the Babylonian plain. The glories and the depths remain,
deeper and more glorious, with all the added marvels
of man's exploring thought. The seeing eye which a true
education will one day give us, may read man's history
in the world we live in, and read the world with the full
illumination of a united human vision&mdash;the eyes of us all.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS IN PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">J.A. Smith</span></h3>


<p>To contend that there has been progress in Philosophy
may seem but a desperate endeavour. For the reproach
against it of unprogressiveness is of long standing: where
other forms of human knowledge have undoubtedly
advanced, Philosophy, in modern times at any rate,
has (so it is said) remained stationary, propounding its
outworn problems, its vain and empty solutions. Because
of this failure it has by common consent been deposed
from its once proud position at the head of the sciences
and obliged to confess, in the words of the Trojan queen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">modo maxima rerum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nunc trahor exul inops.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The charge of unprogressiveness is not made against it
by its foes alone; the truth of it is admitted by some of
its best friends. If Voltaire exclaims 'O m&eacute;taphysique,
m&eacute;taphysique, nous sommes aussi avanc&eacute;s qu'aux temps
des Druides', Kant sadly admits the fact, sets himself
to diagnose its cause, and if possible to discover or devise
a remedy. Yet we must remember that it was philosophers
who first descried those currents in the world of events
which the non-philosophic, borrowing the name from
them, call Progress, who first attempted to determine
their direction and the possible goal of their convergence,
and laboured to clear their own and others' minds in
regard to the meaning, to capture which the name was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
thrown out as a net into the ocean of experience. Nor
must we forget that it was in their own chosen field&mdash;the
world of human thoughts and actions&mdash;that they
from the beginning seemed to themselves to find the surest
evidence of the reality of Progress. While the world that
surrounded and hemmed them and their fellows in might
or must be regarded as unchanging and unchangeable,
doomed for ever to reproduce and monotonously reiterate
whatsoever it had once done and been, the mind or spirit
of Man in its own realm seemed capable of going beyond
all its past achievements and rising to new heights, not
merely here and there or in isolated instances but in such
numbers or masses as to raise for long periods of history
the general level of human efficiency and welfare. It is
true that many of those who noted these advances or
profited by them did not always admit that they took
place in, or were due to the agency of, Philosophy. The
advances were most often credited to other powers and
the new territory claimed by their representatives. The
contributions made by Philosophy to the general improvement
of human life were and are obscure, difficult to
trace, easily missed or forgotten. It came about that
the philosopher was misconceived as one indifferent to
ordinary human interests and disdainful of the more
obvious advantages secured by others, pressing and urging
forward and upward into a cloudland where the light
was too dim for the eyes of man and the paths too uncertain
for his feet. Unsatisfied with the region where Man
had learned by the slow and painful lessons of experience
to build himself a habitable city he dreamed of something
higher, aspiring to explore beyond and above where the
light of that experience shone and illuminated. Perhaps
the main idea that the name of Philosophy now to most
suggests is that of a Utopian ideal of knowledge so wide
and so high that it must be by sane and sober minds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
pronounced for ever set beyond the reach of human
faculty, an ideal which perhaps we cannot help forming
and which constantly tempts us forward like a mirage,
but which like a mirage leads us into waste and barren
places, so much so that it is no small part of human
wisdom to resist its subtle seductions and to confine our
efforts to the pursuit of such ends as we may reasonably
regard as well within the compass of our powers of thought
and action. It is folly, we are told, to adventure ourselves
upon the uncharted seas into which philosophers invite
us, to waste our lives and perhaps break our hearts in the
vain search for a knowledge that is for ever denied us.
After all, there is much that we can know, and in the
knowledge of which we can better the estate of Man,
relieving him from many of his most pressing terrors
and distresses. To cherish other hopes is to deceive ourselves
to our own and our fellows' undoing, to refuse
them our help and fail to play our part in the common
business of mankind. There is surely in the world
enough suffering and sorrow and sin to engage all our
energies in dealing with them, nor are our endeavours to
do so so plainly fruitless as to discourage from perseverance
in them. Where in this task our hearts do faint and
fail, are there not other means than the discredited nostrum
of Philosophy to revive our hopes and recruit our
forces? It was only, we are sometimes reminded, in
the darkest days of human history that men turned
desperately to Philosophy for comfort and consolation&mdash;how
surely and demonstrably, we are told, in vain!
When other duties are so urgent and immediate, have we
even the right to consume our energies otherwise than in
their direct discharge? And is it not presumption to
ask for any further light than that which is vouchsafed
to us in the ordinary course of experience or, if that is
insufficient, in and by Religion?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Much in this plea for a final relinquishment of aid from
Philosophy in the furtherance of human progress is
plausible and more than plausible. Yet the hope or, if
you will, the dream of attaining some form or kind or
degree of knowledge which the sciences do not and cannot
supply and perhaps deny to be possible, some steadiness
and firmness of assurance other and beyond the confidence
of religious faith, is not yet extinct, is perhaps inextinguishable,
and though it often takes extravagant and even
morbid and repulsive forms, still haunts and tantalizes
many, nor these the least wise or sane of our kind, so that
they count all the labour they spend upon its search worth
all the pains. Not for themselves alone do they seek it;
they view themselves as not alone in the quest, but
engaged in a matter of universally human moment. In
the measure in which they count themselves to have
attained any result they do not hoard it or grudge it to
others. The notion of philosophic truth as something
to be shared and enjoyed only by a few&mdash;as what is
called 'esoteric'&mdash;is no longer in vogue and is indeed felt
to involve an essential self-contradiction; rather it is
conceived as something the value of which is assured and
enhanced by being imparted. Those who believe themselves
to be by nature or (it may be) accident appointed
to the office of its quest, by no means feel that they are
thereby divided from their fellows as a peculiar people
or a privileged and exclusive priesthood, but much
rather as fellow servants enlisted and engaged in the
public service of mankind. Least of all do they believe
that their efforts are foredoomed to inevitable failure,
that progress therein is not to be looked for, or that they
and their predecessors have hitherto made no advance
towards what they and, as they also believe, all men sought
and still seek. To them the history of Philosophy for say
the last two thousand years is not the dreary and dispiriting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
narrative of repeated error and defeat, but the record
of a slow but secure and steady advance in which, as nowhere
else, the mind of Man celebrates and enjoys triumphs
over the mightiest obstacles, kindling itself to an ever-brightening
flame. Reviewing its own past in history the
spirit of Philosophy sees its own inner light, which is
its act and its essence, constantly increasing, spreading
ever wider into the circumambient dark, and touching
far-off and hitherto undiscovered peaks with the fire
of a coming dawn. In place of the starlight of Science
or the moonlight of Religion it sees a sun arise flooding
the world with light and warmth and life. High hopes,
high claims; but can they be made good, or even rationally
entertained? Suffice it here that they be openly
avowed and proclaimed to be laid up in the heart of the
philosophic spirit, 'dreaming', and yet with waking eyes,
'of things to come'. Or rather shall we not say, seeing
that its eyes are unsealed and the vision therefore no
dream, beholding a present&mdash;an ever-present&mdash;Reality?</p>

<p>It was Philosophy, or philosophers, as I have said, that
first discerned the fact of Progress, named it, and divined
its lineaments. To Philosophy the name and notion of
Progress belongs as of right&mdash;the right of first occupation.
Merely to have invented a name for the fact is no small
service, for thus the fact was fixed for further study and
examination. But with the name Philosophy gave us
the idea, the notion, and therewith the fact began to be
understood and to become amenable to further and further
explanation. To this further explanation Philosophy gave
notable assistance. To 'elaborate our concepts' has been
said to be the whole business of Philosophy, that is, to
arrest the vague and shifting meanings that float before
our minds loosely attached to the words of ordinary
careless speech, to fix their outlines, distinguishing,
defining, ordering and organizing until each mass of mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>ing
is improved and refined into a thought worthy to be
called a notion, a fit member of the world of mind,
a seat and source of intellectual light. In this work
Philosophy proceeds and succeeds simply by reflecting
on whatever meaning it has in whatever manner already
acquired; it employs no strange apparatus or recondite
methods, only continues more thoughtfully and conscientiously
to use the familiar means by which the earlier
simpler meanings were appropriated and developed,
following the beaten tracks of the mind's native and
spontaneous movement. Much more rarely than the
sciences has it recourse to a technical vocabulary, being
content to express itself in ordinary words though using
them and their collocations with a careful delicacy and
painstaking adroitness. To follow it in these uses demands
an effort, for nothing is perhaps more difficult than to
force our thoughts to run counter to our customary heedless
use of words and to learn to employ them even for
a short time with a steady precision of significance. Yet
unless this effort is resolutely made we must remain the
easy prey of manifold confusions and errors which trip
us in the dark. Our words degrade into tokens which
experience will not cash&mdash;tangles of symbols which we
cannot retranslate.</p>

<p>But Philosophy is more than the attempt to refine and
subtilize our ordinary words so as to fit them for the
higher service of interpretative thought, more even than
the endeavour to improve the stock of ideas no matter
how come by, by which we interpret to ourselves whatever
it imports us to understand. All this it is and does,
or strives to do, but only as subsidiary to its true business
and real aim. All this it might do and do successfully,
and yet make or bring about no substantial progress in
itself or elsewhere. And when progress in Philosophy is
spoken of, it is not either such improvement in language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
nor such improvement in ideas that alone or mainly is
meant.</p>

<p>What is claimed for (or denied to it) under the name of
Progress is an advance in knowledge, knowledge clear-sighted,
grounded, and assured, knowledge of some
authentic and indubitable reality. It is by the attainment
of such knowledge, by progress in and towards it, that
the claim of Philosophy to be progressive must stand or
fall. To the question whether it can make good its claim
to the possession and increase of this knowledge we must
give special attention, for if Philosophy fails in this it
fails in all.</p>

<p>The oldest name for the knowledge in question was
simply Wisdom and, in some ways, in spite of its apparent
arrogance this is the best name for what is sought&mdash;or
missed. Yet from the beginning the name was felt not
sufficiently to distinguish what was meant from the high
skill of the cunning craftsman and the worldly wisdom
of the man of affairs, the statesman or soldier or trader.
In the case of all these it was difficult to disengage the
knowledge involved from natural or trained practical
dexterity. What was desired and required was knowledge
distinguished but not divorced from practice and application&mdash;'pure
knowledge' as it was sometimes called; not
divorced, I repeat, for it was not conceived as without
bearing upon the conduct of life, but still distinguished,
as furnishing light rather than profit. For good or evil
Philosophy began by considering what it sought and hoped
to reach as pre-eminently knowledge in some distinctive
sense, and having so begun it turned to reflect once more
upon what it meant by so conceiving it and to make this
meaning more precise and clear. So it came to present
to itself as its aim or goal a special kind or degree of
knowledge, to be inspired and guided by the hope of that.
Practical as in many ways was the concern of ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
philosophy&mdash;its whole bent was towards the bettering
of human life&mdash;it sought to achieve this by the extension
and deepening of knowledge, and not either through the
cultivation or refinement of emotion or the organization
of practical, civil or social or philanthropic activities.
It laboured&mdash;and laboured not in vain&mdash;to further the
increase of knowledge by defining to itself in advance the
kind or degree of knowledge which would accomplish
the ultimate aim of its endeavour or subserve its accomplishment.
Hence we must learn to view with a sympathetic
eye its repeated essays to give precision and detail
to the conception or ideal of knowledge.</p>

<p>In form the answer rendered to its request to itself for
a definition, was determined by the principle that the
knowledge which was sought and alone, if found, could
satisfy, was knowledge of the real, or as it was at first
more simply expressed, of what is, or what really and
veritably is. Refusing the name of knowledge except
to what had this as its object, men turned to consider
the nature of the object which stood or could stand in
this relation. With this they contrasted what we, after
them, call the phenomena, the appearances, the manifold
aspects, constantly shifting with the shifting points of
view of the observer or many observers of it, inconstant,
unsteady, superficial, mirrored through the senses and
imagination, multiplied and distorted in divergent and
changing opinions, or misrepresented and even caricatured
in the turbid medium of ordinary speech, like a clouded
image on the broken waters of a rushing stream. 'It'&mdash;so
at first they spoke of the object of true or 'philosophic'
knowledge&mdash;was one and single, eternal and unchangeable,
a universe or world-order of parts fixed for ever in their
external relations and inward structure. In each and all
of us there was, as it were, a tiny mirror that could be
cleared so as to reflect all this, and in so far as such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
reflection took place an inner light was kindled in each
which was a lamp to his path. Knowing&mdash;for to know
was so to reflect the world as it really was&mdash;knowing, man
came to self-possession and self-satisfaction&mdash;to peace
and joy&mdash;and was even 'on this bank and shoal of time'
raised beyond the reach of all accidents and evils of
mortal existence&mdash;looking around and down upon all
that could harm or hurt him and seeing it to be in its
law-abiding orderliness and eternal changelessness the
embodiment of good. So viewing it, man learned to feel
the Universe his true home, and was inspired not only
with awe but with a high loyalty and public spirit. 'The
poet says "Dear City of Cecrops", and shall I not say
"Dear City of God"?'</p>

<p>The knowledge thus reached or believed to be attainable
was more and more discriminated from what was offered
or supplied by Art or Science or Religion, though it was
still often confused with each and all of them. As opposed
to that of Art, it was not direct or immediate vision
flashed as it were upon the inner eye in moments of inspiration
or excitement; as opposed to that of Science, it was
a knowledge that pierced below the surface and the
seeming of Nature and History; as opposed to that of
Religion (which was rather faith than knowledge), it was
sober, unimaginative, cleansed of emotional accompaniment
and admixture, the 'dry light' of the wise soul. True
to the principle which I have stated, ancient Philosophy
proclaimed that the only knowledge in the end worth
having was knowledge of Fact&mdash;of what lay behind all
seeming however fair&mdash;Fact unmodified and unmodifiable
by human wish or will; it bade us know the world in
which we live and move and have our being, know it as
it is truly and in itself, and knowing it love it, loyally
acquiescing in its purposes and subserving its ends. In
all this there was progress (was there not?) to a view, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a truth (how else shall we speak of it?) which has always,
when apprehended, begotten a high temper in heroic
hearts. Surely in having reached in thought so high and
so far the mind of man had progressed in knowledge and
in wisdom.</p>

<p>But now a change took place, from which we must date
the rise or birth of modern philosophy. Hitherto on the
whole the mind of man had looked outward and sought
knowledge of what lay or seemed to lie outside itself.
So looking and gazing ever deeper it had encountered
a spectacle of admirable and awe-compelling order, yet
one which for that very reason seemed appallingly
remote from, if not alien to, all human businesses and
concerns. Now it turned inward and found within itself
not only matter of more immediate or pressing interest,
but a world that compelled attention, excited curiosity,
rewarded study. Slowly and gradually the knowledge of
this, the inner world&mdash;the world of the thinker's self&mdash;became
the central object of philosophic reflection. The
knowledge that was most required&mdash;that was all-important
and indispensable (so man began explicitly to realize)&mdash;was
knowledge of the Self, not of the outer world that at
best could never be more than known, but of the self
that knew or could know it, that could both know
and be known. Henceforward what is studied is not
knowledge of reality&mdash;of any and every reality&mdash;or of
external reality, but knowledge of the Self which can
know as well as be known. And the process by which it
is sought is reflection, for the self-knowledge is not the
knowledge of other selves, but the knowledge of just
that Self which knows itself and no other. Thus the
knowledge sought is once more and now finally distinguished
from the knowledge offered or supplied by Art
or Science or Religion: not by Art, for the Self cannot
appear and has no seeming nor can it any way be pictured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
or described or imagined; not by Science, for it lies beyond
and beneath and behind all observation, nor can it be
counted or measured or weighed; not by Religion, for
knowledge of it comes from within and the disclosure of
its nature is by the self-witness of the Self to its self, not
by revelation of any other to it. Thus there is disclosed
the slowly-won and slowly-revealed secret of modern
Philosophy, that the knowledge which is indispensable,
which is necessary as the consummation and key-stone
of all other knowledge, is knowledge of the knowing-self,
self-knowledge, or, as it is sometimes more technically
called, self-consciousness, with the corollary that this
knowledge cannot be won by any methods known to or
specially characteristic of Science or Art or Religion. To
become self-conscious, to progress in self-consciousness
is the end, and the way or means to it is by reflection&mdash;the
special method of Philosophy.</p>

<p>This is the step in advance made by the modern spirit
beyond all discoveries of the ancients; it is the truth by
the apprehension of which the modern spirit and its world
is made what it is. Not outside us lies Truth or the Truth:
Truth dwelleth in the inner man&mdash;<i>in interiore hominis
habitat veritas</i>. Is this not progress, progress in wisdom,
and to what else can we ascribe the advance save to
Philosophy?</p>

<p>It was one of the earliest utterances of modern Philosophy,
and one which it has never found reason to retract,
that the Self which knows can and does know itself better
than aught else whatsoever, and in that knowledge can
without end make confident and sure-footed advance.
To itself the Self is the most certain and the most knowable
of all realities&mdash;with this it is most acquainted, this it
has light in itself to explore, of this it can confidently
foresee and foretell the method of advance to further and
further knowledge. It knows not only its existence but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
its essence, its nature, and it knows by what procedure,
by what ordered effort or exercise of will it can progress
to height beyond height of its self-knowledge. I say, it
knows it, but it also knows that that knowledge cannot be
attained all at once or taken complete and ready-made,
for it <i>is</i> itself a progress, a self-created and self-determined
progress, and on that condition progress alone is or is real.
For it to be is not to be at the beginning or at the end of
this process, but to be always coming to be, coming to be
what it is not and yet also what it has in it to be. Of
nothing else is Progress so intimately the essence and very
being; if we ask 'What progresses or evolves?', the most
certain answer is 'The spirit which is in man, and what
it progresses in, is knowledge of itself, which is wisdom'.
Speaking of and for Philosophy I venture to maintain
that nothing is more certain than that that spirit which
has created it has grown, is growing, and will ever grow in
wisdom, and that by reflection upon itself and its history&mdash;nor
can the gates of darkness and error prevail against
the irresistible march of its triumphant progress.</p>

<p>As we look back the history of Philosophy seems
strewn with the debris of outworn or outlived errors,
but out of them all emerges this clear and assured truth,
that in self-knowledge lies the master-light of all our
seeing, inexhaustibly casting its rays into the retreating
shadow world that now surrounds us, melting all mists
and dispelling all clouds, and that the way to it is unveiled,
mapped and charted in advance so that henceforward we
can walk sure-footedly therein. Yet that does not mean
that the work of Philosophy is done, that it can fold its
hands and sit down, for only in the seeking is its prize
found and there is no goal or end other than the process
itself. For this too is its discovery, that not by, but in,
endless reflection is the Truth concerning it known, the
Truth that each generation must ever anew win and earn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it for itself. The result is not without the process, nor
the end without the means: the fact <i>is</i> the process and
other fact there is none. In other forms of so-called
'knowledge' we can sever the conclusion from its premisses,
and the result can be given without the process,
but with self-knowledge it is not so and no generation,
or individual, can communicate it ready-made to another,
but can only point the way and bid others help themselves.
And if this, so put, seems hard doctrine, I can only remind
you that to philosophize has always meant 'to think by
and for oneself'.</p>

<p>It is perhaps more necessary to formulate the warning
that what is here called self-knowledge and pronounced
to constitute the very essence of the spirit that is in man,
is far removed from what sometimes bears its name, the
extended and minute acquaintance by the individual
mind with its individual peculiarities or idiosyncrasies,
its weaknesses and vanities, its whims and eccentricities;
nor is it to be confused with the still wider acquaintance
with those that make up our common human nature in
all its folly and frailty which is sometimes called 'knowledge
of human nature'; no, nor with such knowledge
as psychological science, with its methods of observation
and induction and experiment, offers or supplies. It is
knowledge of something that lies far deeper within us&mdash;'the
inward man', which is not merely alike or akin
but is the same in all of us; beneath all our differences,
strong against all our weaknesses, wise against all our
follies, what each of us rightly calls his true self and yet
what is not his alone, but all men's also. As we reflect
upon it duly, what discloses or reveals itself to us is
a self which is both our very own and yet common or
universal, the self of each and yet the self of all. The more
we get to apprehend and understand it, the more we become
and know ourselves, not so much as being but as becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
one with one another; the differences that sunder us in
feeling and thought and action melting away like mist.
The removal of these differences is just the unveiling of
it, in which it at once comes to be and to be known.
In coming to know it we create it. The unity of the spirit
thus becomes and is known as indubitable fact, or rather
(I must repeat) not as fact, as if it were or were anything
before being known, but as something which is ever more
and more coming to be, in the measure in which it is coming
to be known&mdash;known to itself. For this is the hard lesson
of modern philosophy, that our inmost nature and most
genuine self is not aught ready-made or given, but something
which is created in and by the process of our
coming to know it, which progresses in existence and
substantiality and value as our knowledge of it progresses
in width and depth and self-assurance. The process is
one of creative&mdash;self-creative&mdash;evolution, in which each
advance deposits a result which prescribes the next step
and supplies all the conditions for it, and so constantly
furnishes all that is required for an endless progress in
reality and worth. This is the process in which the spirit
of man capitalizes and substantiates its activities, committing
its gains to secure custody, amassing and using
them for its self-enrichment&mdash;in which it depends on no
other than itself and is sovereign master of its future and
its fate. This is the way in which selves are made, or
rather, make themselves.</p>

<p>This is the discovery of modern Philosophy, the now
patent secret which it offers for the interpretation of all
mysteries and the solving of all problems&mdash;and it offers
it with unquestioning assurance, for it has explored the
ground and has awakened to the true method of progress
within it. And as I have said or implied, to the reflective
mind regress is impossible, it cannot go back upon itself,
and with due tenderness and gratitude it has set behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
it the things of its unreflective childhood. It stands on
the stable foundation of the witness of the spirit within
us to itself, to its own nature, its own powers and its own
rights; it knows itself as the knower, the interpreter, the
teacher, and therefore the master and maker of itself.
Yet we must not identify or confuse this our deeper or
deepest self which we thus create with the separate selves
or souls which each of us is; it is not any one of them
nor all of them together, unless we give to the word
'together' a new and more pregnant sense than it has
yet come to bear. It is not the 'tribal' or 'collective'
or 'social' self, for it is not made by congregation or
collection or association, but by some far more intimate
unification than is signified by any of these terms, namely
by coming together in and by knowledge. It is the spirit
which is in us all and in which we all are, which is more yet
not other than we, without which we are nothing and do
nothing and yet which is veritably the spirit of man, the
immortal hero of all the tragedy and comedy&mdash;the whole
drama&mdash;of human history; it is of this spirit as it is by
it, that Philosophy has in repeated and resolute reflection
come to know the nature and the method of its progress.
Such knowledge has come into the world and prevails
more widely and more potently than ever before; possessed
in fullness by but a few, it is open and available
to all and radiates as from a beacon light over the whole
field of human experience; at that fire every man can
light his candle. This is the light in which alone the record
of man's thoughts and achievements can be construed
and which exhibits them as steps and stages on that
triumphant march to higher and higher levels such as
alone we can rightly name Progress. Where else than in
History, and, above all, in the History of Knowledge, is
Progress manifested, and in that where more certainly
than in the unretreating and unrevoked advance towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
a deeper, a truer, a wiser knowledge of itself by the spirit
that is in and is, Man?</p>

<p>Yes, such knowledge, truth and wisdom now exists and
is securely ours, though to inherit it each generation and
each individual must win it afresh and having won it
must develop and promote it, or it ceases not only to work
but to be. For it exists only as it is made or rather only
in the act and fact of its progress, and so for it not to
progress is at once to return to impotence and nothingness.
And it is we who maintain it in being, maintaining it by
endless reiterated efforts of reflection, and so maintaining
it we maintain ourselves, resting or relying upon it and
using it as a source of strength and a fulcrum or a platform
for further effort. Upon self-knowledge in this sense all
other 'knowledge' reposes; upon it and the knowledge of
other selves and the world, which flows from it, depends
the possibility of all practical advance. In the dark all
progress is impossible.</p>

<p>But since this discovery was made and made good, the
spirit of Philosophy has not stood still; it has gone on,
and is still going on, to extend and deepen and secure its
conquests. Once more it has turned from its fruitful
and enlightening concentration on the inner self and its
life to review what lies or seems to lie around and outside
it. It finds that those who have stayed, or fallen, behind
its audacious but justified advance in self-knowledge, still
cherish a view of what is external to this (the true or real
self so now made patent), thoughts or fancies which
misconceive and misrepresent it&mdash;thoughts persisted in
against the feebler protesting voices of Art and Religion
and so held precariously and unstably though apparently
grounded upon the authority of Science. To the unphilosophic
or not yet philosophic mind the spirit of man, already
in imagination multiplied and segregated into individual
'souls', appears to be surrounded with an environment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of alien character, often harsh to man's emotions, often
rebellious or untractable to his purposes, often impenetrable
to his understanding, and in a word indifferent or
hostile to his ideals and aspirations after progress and good.
Nay, the individual souls seem to act towards one another
separately and collectively as such hindrances, and again,
each individual soul seems to be encrusted with insuperable
impediments. Even the light within is enclosed in an
opaque screen which prevents or counteracts its outflow,
so that the spirit within is as it were entombed or imprisoned.
'Wall upon wall, the gross flesh hems us in,'
we cannot communicate with one another or join with
one another in thought or deed; and the hope of progress
seems defeated by the recalcitrant matter that shell upon
shell encases us. The world of our bodies, of the bodies and
spirits of others, and all the vast <i>compages</i> of things and
forces which we call 'Nature' blinds and baffles us, mocks
our hopes and breaks our hearts. How idle to dream that
amidst and against all this neutrality or hostility any
substantial or secure advance can be made!</p>

<p>In answer to all these thoughts, these doubts and fears,
Philosophy is beginning with increasing boldness to speak
a word, not of mere comfort and consolation, but of secure
and confident wisdom. All this so-called 'external'
nature and environment is not hostile or alien to the
self or spirit which is in man, it is akin and allied to it
as we now know it to be. Whatever is real and not merely
apparent in History or Nature is rational, is of the same
stuff and character as that which is within us. It too
is spiritual, the appearance and embodiment of what is
one in nature and mode of being with what lies deepest
and is most potent in us. So far as it is not that, it is
appearance and not reality, woven like a dream by
imagination or endowed with an unstable and shifting
quasi-reality by our thoughts and suppositions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
fancies about we know not what. Not that it is an illusion,
still less a delusion, rather what it is is the outward
and visible sign of an inward and spiritual reality, a symbol
beautiful, orderly, awe-inspiring yet mutilated, partial,
confused, of something deeper and more real, the expression,
the face and gesture, of a spirit that, as ours does,
knows itself, its own profound being and meaning, and
does what it does in the light of such knowledge, a spirit
which above all progresses endlessly towards and in a
richer and fuller knowledge of itself. What we call Fact&mdash;historical
or natural&mdash;is essentially such an expression,
on the one hand a finished expression, set in the past
and therefore for ever beyond the possibility of change
and so of progress, an exhausted or dead expression, on
the other hand a passing into the light of what was before
unknown even to the expresser's self, an act by which
was made and secured a self-discovery or self-revelation,
a creative act of self-knowledge and so significant and
interpretable. This double character of events in History
and Nature is dimly descried in what we specially call
'nature', but comes more fully into view in the sphere
of human history, where each step is at once a deed and
a discovery, a contribution to the constitution of the world
of fact and a fulguration of the light within illuminating
facts as the condition of its own inexhaustible continuance.
The world of Fact, artistic or aesthetic, scientific, moral,
political, economic, is what the spirit builds round itself,
creating it out of its own substance, while it itself in
creating it grows within, evolving out of itself into itself
and advancing in knowledge or wisdom and power. And
out of its now securely won self-knowledge it declares
that it&mdash;itself&mdash;is the source and spring of all real fact
whatsoever, which is its self-created expression, made by
it in its own interests, and for its own good, the better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and better to know itself. Nothing is or can be alien,
still less hostile to it, for 'in wisdom has it made them
all'. Looking back and around it re-reads in all fact the
results of its own power of self-expression. Nothing is but
what it has made.</p>

<p>All this might perhaps have been put very simply by
saying that ever since man has set himself to know his
own mind in the right way, he has succeeded better and
better, and that in knowing his own mind he has come to
know and is still coming to know all else beside, including
all that at first sight seems other than, or even counter
to, his own mind. He has learned what manner of being
he is, how that being has been made and how it continues
to be made and developed, and again, how in the course of
its self-creation and self-advance it deposits itself in 'fact'
and reflecting on that fact rises beyond and above itself
in knowledge and power. He is mind or spirit, and what
lies behind and around him is spiritual. As he reflects
upon this the meaning of it becomes ever more clear
and distinct, ordered and organized, and at the same time
more substantial, more real, more lively and potent. In
becoming known what was before dead and dark and
threatening or obstructive or hostile is made transparent,
alive, utilisable, contributing to the constantly growing
self that knows and is known. Here is the growing point
of reality, the <i>fons emanationis</i> of truth and worth and
being, evidencing its power not as it were in increase of
bulk, but in the enhancing of value. And surely here is
Progress, which consists not in mere enlargement or
expansion but in the heightening of forces to a new power&mdash;in
a word, in their elevation to a more spiritual, a more
intelligent and therefore more potent, level.</p>

<p>To the artistic eye the universe presents itself as a vast
and moving spectacle, to the scientific mind as the theatre
of forces which repeat their work with a mechanical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
uniformity or perhaps fatally run down to a predestined and
predictable final arrest, to the devout or religious soul as
the constant efflux of a beneficent will, unweariedly kind,
caring for the humblest of its creatures, august, worshipful,
deserving of endless adoration and love, while to the philosophic
mind it is known and ever more to be known
as the self-expression of a mind in essence one with all
minds that know it in knowing themselves, know it as
the work or product of a mind engaged or absorbed in
knowing itself, and so creating itself and all that is
requisite that it may learn more and more what is hidden
or stored from all eternity within its plenitude. At least
we may say that the conception of a Mind which in order
to know itself creates the conditions of such knowledge,
which wills to learn whatever can be learned of itself from
whatever it does, supplies the best pattern or original
after which to model our vaguer and more blurred
conceptions of progressive existence and being elsewhere.
It furnishes to us an ideal of a progress which realizes or
maintains and advances itself, for it is independent upon
external conditions. The Progress of Philosophy or of
Wisdom is a palmary instance of progress achieved out of
the internal resources of that which progresses. And after
this pattern we least untruly and least unworthily conceive
the mode of that eternal and universal Progress which is
the life of the Whole within and as part of which we live.</p>

<p>The aim of Philosophy is not edification but the
possession and enjoyment of Truth, and the Truth may
wear an aspect which, while it enlightens, also blinds or
even at first appals and paralyses. And certainly Reality
or Philosophy as has come to know it and proclaims it
to be, is not such as either directly to warm our hearts or
stimulate our energies. Not to do either has Philosophy
come into the world, nor so does it help to bring Progress
about; nor does it offer prizes to those who pursue either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
moral improvement or business success, nor again does it
increase that information concerning 'nature' and men
which is the condition of the one and the other, yet to those
who love Truth and who will buy no good at the sacrifice
of it, what it offers is enough, and to progress towards and
in it is for them worth all the world beside; it is, if not
the only real progress, that in the absence of which all
other progress is without worth or substance or reality.
In the end, if any advance anywhere is claimed or asserted,
must we not ask: Is the claim founded on truth, is the
good or profit seemingly attained a (or the) true good? To
whom or to what is it good? Can we stop short of the
endeavour to assure ourselves beyond question or doubt
that we are right in what answers we render? And
where or by what means can we reach this save by turning
inward on meditation or reflection, that is by philosophizing?
<span class='correction' title='Ei philosophêteon philosophêteon, ei de mê, philosophêteon; pantôs ara philosophêteon'>&#917;&#7984; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#8051;&#959;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#959;&#957;, &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#956;&#8053;, &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#8051;&#959;&#957;;

has always turned when the burden of the mystery
of its nature and fate has weighed all but intolerably
upon it, and turning has never found itself betrayed, but
from knowledge of itself has drawn fresh hope and
strength to resume the uninterrupted march of Progress
which is its life and its history, its being, its self-formation,
in courage moving forwards in and towards the light. It
is as if such light were not merely the condition of its
welfare, but the food on which it lived, the stuff which it
transmuted into substance and energy, out of it making,
maintaining and building its very self. So under whatever
name, whether we call what we are doing Philosophy or
something else, the search for more and more light upon
ourselves and our world is the most indispensable activity
to which the leagued and co-operative powers of Man can
be devoted. Fortunately it is also that in which success
or failure depends most certainly upon ourselves and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which Progress can with most confidence be looked for.
In it we cannot fail if we will to take sufficient trouble;
the means to it are open and available; it is our fault
if we do not employ them and profit by them. If we have
less wisdom than we might have, it is never any one's
fault but our own. The door of the treasure-house of
Wisdom stands ever open.</p>

<h2>PROGRESS AS AN IDEAL OF ACTION</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">J. A. Smith</span></h3>


<p>Throughout this course of lectures, now come to its
close, we have together been engaged in a theoretical
inquiry. We have been looking mainly towards the past,
to something therefore for ever and in its very nature set
beyond the possibility of alteration by us or indeed at all.
'What is done not even God can make to be undone.'
Were it otherwise it could not be fact or reality and so
not capable of being theorized or studied. In the words
of our programme we have analysed what is involved
in the conception of Progress, shown when it became
prominent in the consciousness of mankind and how far
the idea has been realized&mdash;that is has become fact&mdash;in
the different departments of life. We have taken Progress
as a fact, something accomplished, and have attempted
so taking it to explain or understand it. We have not
indeed assumed that it is confined to the past, but have
at times enlarged our consideration so as to recognize its
continuance in the present and to justify the hope of its
persistence in the future. Some of us would perhaps go
further and hold that it has, by these and similar reflections,
come to be part of our assured knowledge that it
must so continue and persist. But however we have
widened our purview, what we call Progress has remained
to us a course or movement which still presents the appearance
of a fact which is largely, if not wholly, independent
of us&mdash;a fact because independent of us&mdash;to which we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
occupy no other attitude than that of interested spectators,
interested and concerned, moved or conditioned by it
but not active or co-operative in it. So far as it is in
process of realization in the vast theatre of nature, inorganic
or organic, dead or living, that surrounds us, it
pursues its course in virtue of powers not ours and
unamenable to our control. And even when we view it
within the closer environment of human history its current
seems to carry us irresistibly with it. Its existence is
indeed of very practical concern to us, but apparently all
we can do is to come to know it, and knowing it to allow
for it as or among the set conditions of our self-originated
or self-governed actions if such actions there be.</p>

<p>The clearer we have become as to the nature of Progress,
the more it would appear that it must be for us, because
it is in itself, a fact to be recognized in theory, taken into
account and reckoned with. It is or it is not, comes to be
or does not come to be, and what we have first and foremost
to seek, is light upon its existence and character as it
is or occurs. Light, we hope, has been cast upon it. We
have learned that in its inmost essence and to its utmost
bounds Reality&mdash;what lies outside and around us&mdash;is not
fixed, rigid, immobile, was not and is not and cannot be as
the ancient or mediaeval mind feigned or fabled, something
beyond the reach of time and change&mdash;static or stationary&mdash;but
is itself a process of ceaseless alteration. We have
learned also to be dissatisfied with the compromise which,
while acknowledging such alteration, all but withdraws
it in effect by asserting it to be either in gross or in detail
a process of mere repetition. The system of laws which
science had taught us to consider as the truth of nature
is itself now known to be caught in the evolutionary process,
and to be undergoing a constant modification. As
in the modern state, so in Nature, the legislative power
is not exhausted but incessantly embodies itself in novel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
forms. Nature itself&mdash;<i>natura naturans</i>&mdash;is now conceived,
and rightly conceived, as a power not bound to laws
other than those which it makes for or imposes on itself,
and as in its operations at least analogous to a will self-determined,
self-governing, creative of the ways and means
by which its purpose or purposes are achieved. What
that purpose is we have begun to apprehend, and to see
its various processes as converging or co-operating
towards its fulfilment. In the mythological language
which even Science is still obliged to use, we now speak
of Nature as 'selecting' or 'devising', and we ascribe
to it a large freedom of choice wisely used. We can
already at least define the process as guided towards
a greater variety and fullness and harmony of life, or (with
a larger courage) as pointed towards a heightening or
potentiation of life. So defining its goal we can sympathize
with and welcome the successful efforts made toward
it, and so feel ourselves at heart one with the power that
carries on the process in its aspirations and its efforts.
But still, we cannot help feeling, it and all its ways lie
outside us, and to us it remains an alien or foreign power.
I venture to repeat my contention that this is so just
because, however much we come to learn of its ways, we
do not feel that we are coming to understand it any
better, getting inside it, as we do get inside and understand
human nature. Its progress is a change, perhaps
a betterment, in our environment&mdash;in externals&mdash;and
takes place very largely whether we will and act or no.
The larger our acquaintance with it, the more does its
action seem to encroach upon the domain within which
our volitions and acts can make any difference. Even in
social life we seem in the grip and grasp of forces which
carry us towards evil or good whether we will or no.
<i>Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.</i> The whole known
universe outside and around us presents to us the spectacle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of what has been called a <i>de facto</i> teleology, and just
because it is so, and so widely and deeply so, it leaves
little or no room for us to set up our ideals within it and
to work for their realization. The fact that the laws
which prevail in it are modifiable and modified makes no
difference; they modify themselves, and in their different
forms still constrain us. And no matter how increasingly
beneficent they may in their action appear, they are still
despotic and we unfree. The rule of laws which Science
discovers encroaches upon our liberties and privacies.
What we had hitherto thought our very own, the movement
of our impulses and desires and imaginations, are
reported by science to be subject to 'laws of association',
and we are borne onwards even if also at times
upwards on an irresistible flood. We remain bound by the
iron necessity of a fate that invades our inmost being&mdash;which
will not let us anywhere securely alone. I repeat
that it matters not how certainly the trend of the tide,
which sets everywhere around and outside us, is towards
what is good or best for us, it still is the case that it presents
itself as neither asking for from us nor permitting to us
the formation of any ideals of ours nor any prospect of
securing them by our efforts. Were the fact of Progress
established and conclusively shown to be all-pervasive
and eternal, it still would bear to us the aspect of a paternal
government which did good to and for us, but all the
more left less and less to ourselves.</p>

<p>This will doubtless be pronounced an exaggeration, and
we may weakly refuse to face the impression naturally
consequent upon the progress we have made in the ascertainment
of the facts concerning the world in which we
live. But does not the impression exist? The hateful
and desolating impression made on us earlier by the
thought of a 'block' universe, once for all and rigidly
fixed in unalterable and uniform subjection to eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and omnipresent law, has dissolved like the baseless
fabric of a vision. And why? Just because being found
intolerable it was faced and put to the question. Now
that there has been substituted for it the spectacle of
a universe necessarily or fatally evolving&mdash;or, as we have
said, progressing&mdash;does it not, while still evoking the old
awe or reverence, do anything but still daunt and dishearten
us? What is our part, we ask, our very own part within
all this? What can we within it do? And the answer,
that it is ours, if we will, to enter into and live in the
contemplation of all this no longer appeals to us. In such
a progressive universe we can no longer feel ourselves
'at home'. In it our active nature would seem to exist
only to be disappointed and rebuffed.</p>

<p>The only progress which we can care for is the progress
which we ourselves bring about, or can believe that we
bring about, in ourselves or our fellows or in the world
immediately around us. So long as what is so named is
something devised and executed by a power not our own&mdash;not
the same as our own&mdash;it may call out from us gratitude
and reverence, but the spectacle of the reality of such
Progress cannot exercise the attractive force nor, so far
as it is realized, beget that creative joy which accompanies
even humble acts in which we set an ideal of our own
before ourselves, and see it through our efforts emerge into
actual existence. A practical ideal must be through and
through of our own making. It must be devised by us and
set to ourselves for our pursuit, and its coming to be, or be
real, must be our doing. The very idea of it must be our
own, not given or prescribed, still less imposed, and the process
towards it must be our doing too. That there should,
on their view of it, ever be protest and rebellion against its
tyrannous demands appears to me reasonable and right,
and those who make it to be guarding the immediate
jewel of man's nature. We should, we might say, if this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
were the whole truth about the universe, acknowledge
ourselves as its sons bound to gratitude and obedience
because of the fatherly care for us, but it would be an
essential complement to our family loyalty that we should
insist upon and make good our claims to be grown-up
sons and fellow citizens, declining to pronounce it wholly
good, if those claims were denied to us. Now all these
conditions seem to make straight against the possibility
of regarding Progress, in the view of it we have hitherto
taken, as an ideal of our action.</p>

<p>In view of this character of the known fact of Progress,
so discouraging and disabling to our active or practical
nature, certain suggestions have been made which are
thought to relieve us from these effects. It is said sometimes
that this fatal&mdash;if beneficent or beneficial, still
fatal&mdash;progress leaves as it were certain interstices in
the universe within which it loses its constraining force,
petty provinces but sufficient, where man is master and
determines all events, from which even, it is sometimes
conceded, some obscure but important influences are
permitted to flow, modifying his immediate surroundings,
little sanctuaries where the spirit that is in him and is his
devises and realizes ideals of its own. But the notion
of such sacrosanct and inviolable autonomies is being
steadily undermined, and they are felt, as science becomes
more dominant over our imaginations and emotions, to
be no more than eddies in the universal stream, only
apparently distinct and self-maintained, means made and
broken for its purpose, really products and instruments
of the world-progress. At any rate, it has been denied
that they can rightfully be thought to stand outside it
or themselves to exercise any effect upon their fortunes
and their fate, still less upon their environment. Another
suggestion fully and frankly acknowledges this, but
though denying to us any power to affect either the form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
or the direction of the currents on which we are borne
along, declares still open to us the possibility of affecting
their speed, and bids us find satisfaction in the thought
that by taking thought or resolve we can hasten or delay
their and the universal movement. Still another view,
abandoning even that hope, proclaims one last choice
open to us, namely, that of sullen submission to, or glad
and loyal acquiescence in, its irresistible sway. But surely
all these suggestions are idle, and but for a moment conceal
or postpone the inevitable conclusion that if Progress
was, is and must or will be, that is, is necessary, what we
think or do makes no difference, and can make no difference
to or in it. Whether or no we convert the fact into
an ideal, whether or no we set it before as our aim and
exert ourselves to work for it, it goes on its way all the
same. Either then it is not a fact, never was, and never
will be a fact, or it is no possible ideal for which we can
act. To be or become a fact, it must be independent of
our action or our consent or our liking; if it is not all
these it is not an ideal of action, or at any rate not so
for us. I must repeat that what is or can be an ideal of
action for us must be wholly and solely of our making,
the very thought of it self-begotten in our mind, every
step to its actual existence the self-created deed of our
will. Not that either idea or act comes into being in
a void or without suggestion and assistance from without
us, but still so that the initiative lies in what we think
or do, and so that without us it is unreal and impossible.
It is enough, indeed, that we should be contributory, but
the ideal must be such that without our irreplaceable
co-operation it must fail. The only Progress in which
we can take an active interest or make an ideal of action,
is one which we conceive and execute, and that the fact
we call Progress is not.</p>

<p>So far we have found much argument to show that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
what we have hitherto called Progress is not and cannot
be an ideal of action, or at least of our action. And now
we must face another argument more plain and apparently
fatal, indeed, specially or peculiarly fatal. For the
very notion of Progress is of a process which continues
without end, or we have the dilemma that it is either
endless or runs to an end in which there is no longer
Progress but something else. In either case it is not
itself an end or the end, and whatever an ideal of action
is, it must be an end&mdash;something beyond which there is
nothing, which has no Beyond at all. To set before oneself
as an ideal of action what one certainly knows to be
incapable of attainment or accomplishment, incapable of
coming to an end&mdash;that is surely futile and vain. Without
a best, better or better-and-better has no meaning, and
when the best is reached Progress is no more.</p>

<p>The objection may be put in various ways, as thus.
What we seek or want or work for, is to be satisfied, and
satisfaction is a state, not a process or a progress. Or
again, acting is a process of seeking, seeking and striving
for something, and surely the seeking cannot itself be
the object of the search. Or once more, what we act for
is, as we must conceive it, something complete, finished,
perfect, but Progress is essentially something incomplete,
unfinished, imperfect. We all feel this, and at times at
least the thought that what we seek flies ever before,
affrights and paralyses: recoiling from such a prospect,
we set before our imaginations as the reward or result
of our labours, not movement but rest, not creation or
production but consumption and fruition. We dream
of one day coming to participate in a life or experience
so good that there is no change from less good to more
good possible within it, and which, if it can be said to
progress at all, only, in Milton's magnificent words, 'progresses
the dateless and irrevoluble circle of its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
perfections, joining inseparable hands with joy and bliss
in over-measure for ever'. Once this ideal has presented
itself to our hopes or desires, it degrades by comparison
with it to a second-best, the former ideal of endless
development from lower to higher. What we want and
seek is to be there, to have done with getting there. 'Here
is the house of fulfilment of craving, this is the cup with
the roses around it.' Compared with this, how disconsolate
a prospect is that 'of the sea that hath no shore
beyond it, set in all the sea'&mdash;the endless voyage or quest.
Not Progress is or can be the end, but achievement and
the enjoyment of it. The progress is towards and for the
end; the end is the supreme good and the progress is only
good because of it, because it is on the way that leads to
it, the way we are content to travel only because it leads
there. Once more, and on still surer grounds, we must
pronounce what we have come to know as Progress to
be no possible ideal of action. What draws us on is the
hope of something to be attained in and by the progress.
To take Progress, which on the one hand is a fact and on
the other is an incomplete fact, to be the end of our
striving and our doing is to acquiesce in a self-contradiction.</p>

<p>Yet the counter-ideal of a state in which we shall
simply rest from our labours and sit down to enjoy the
fruits of them does not promise satisfaction either, and
so cannot be the end or ideal. Our desire and our endeavour
is not for a moveless, changeless, undeveloping
perfection. In fact, so often as the dream of such a state
attained has presented itself, it has to thoughtful minds
appeared anything but attractive or desirable. Our desire
is to go on, and for that we are willing to pay a price&mdash;nay,
it is for more than merely to go on, it is to advance
and increase in perfection, so much so that the ideal itself
once more slews round into its opposite and the search<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
appears worth more than the attainment. It seems that
we were not on the other view so wholly wrong, but must
try so to frame our ideal of action as to unite both
characters and satisfy both demands at once, so that it
shall be at once a state and a movement or process, an
achievement and a progress, a rest or quiet and a striving
after it, a perfection and a perfecting. The combination
at first sight appears impossible. Yet both characters it
must combine. Here again, I must confess that the idea
of mere Progress, even as achieved by our own efforts,
seems to me to omit something essential to an ideal of
action&mdash;of what is worth while our acting for. What is
to be an ideal of action must have the character of a fulfilment&mdash;something
to be consumed, not merely eternally
added to. For this character of the (or any) ideal of
action the best name is fruition or enjoyment. And the
defect in the conception of it as Progress is that it seems
to postpone this without a date.</p>

<p>Let us put this truth which we have discovered concerning
Progress in a nutshell, hiding or disregarding the
internal contradiction. What is the nature, what is the
kind of reality, which we have learned to ascribe to
Progress (for we did pronounce it real and essentially
capable of being realized)? It is that it is fact, yet fact
not made but in the making; it is just the name for
what is real only through and in the process of becoming
real or being realized. Now I have already elsewhere
pointed out that while a realization which is also a reality,
or a reality which is also a realization, is in nature or
what is external to us a mystery and a puzzle, it is just
when we look inwards the open secret of our being; in
our life or action regarded from within, it appears as
something which is only dark because it is so close and
familiar to us that inspection of it is difficult, not because
it is in itself opaque or unintelligible. To its exemplifi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>cation
or illustration there we must turn for light upon
our problem.</p>

<p>Let us for the time disregard the pressure exercised
upon us by the suggestions of physical science, or even,
I may add, popular and imaginative or opinionative&mdash;which
is Latin for 'dogmatic'&mdash;Religion, and examine
how Progress takes place, or is realized and real, within
our spirits, or that spirit which is within us. The inward
process is one by which that spirit is or is real only in the
act or fact of being or coming to be realized, or rather of
realizing itself, and the way in which it so becomes or
makes itself real is by acknowledging its own past, treating
it as fact, recognizing its failures or imperfections therein,
projecting on the future an idea or ideal of itself, suggested
by those apprehended wants or defects, of what
it might be, and using that to supply itself with both
energy and guidance, drawing from its own past both
strength and light. In all this it acts autonomously, out
of itself, and creates both the requisite light and the
indispensable force, making its very limitations into new
sources and reservoirs of both.</p>

<p>We do not sufficiently note and hold and use the indubitable
truth that, in contradistinction to what we call
Nature, the forces of the spirit reinforce and re-create
themselves in their use, are in their use not consumed
but reinvigorated, not dissipated or degraded but recollected
and elevated, not expended but enhanced.
There is in the realm of spirit which is our nature and
our world no law of either the conservation or the degradation
of energy. We must not allow ourselves to be
brow-beaten by arguments drawn from the obscurer
region of physical and external nature. We know ourselves
to be energies or energizing powers which increase
and do not waste by exercise. That is what we ought
to mean by saying that we are wills and not forces,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
spiritual not physical or natural beings. If need be to
confirm ourselves in this knowledge, let us think of what
takes place, has taken place in the advance of knowledge,
and particularly of the most important kind of knowledge,
viz. self-knowledge, how we make it by our reflection
upon what we have already in respect of it achieved,
recognize how it or we have fallen short or over-shot our
mark, define what is required to make good its deficiencies,
and find ourselves thereby already in actual possession
of the preconceived supplement. The real, the fact, what
is attained or accomplished in and by us, prescribes and
facilitates, or rather supplies, its own missing complement
of perfection. The process carries itself on, the
progress realizes itself, the ideal translates itself into the
fact or actuality: it accomplishes itself and yet it is the
doing of our very self, of the spirit within us. All this is
not merely our doing, it is our being, it is the process by
which we make our minds, our souls, our very selves
or self.</p>

<p>That man is essentially an, or rather the, ideal-forming
animal (or rather spirit) has long been noted, and also
that the formation of ideals is an indispensable factor in
his progress, which is his life and very being. But all
the same, this is sometimes put in such a way as to make
action, or at least human action, a dispensable accident
in the universe, an ineffective and unsubstantial unreality,
while at the same time those who put it thus, profess
to see through the illusion and to enjoy moments of
insight which recognize its nullity. This way of putting
it in my judgement intolerably misconceives and misrepresents
the truth.</p>

<p>Our ideals of action must be self-made or self-begotten,
but yet they must be congruent with known fact; but
the manner of such congruence is hard to see, hard to
express. Ideals cannot be themselves facts, and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
cannot be known, but on the other hand they cannot be
mere imaginations or suppositions or beliefs, still less, of
course, illusions or delusions. They are not visionary,
and the apprehension of them is a sort or degree of perception.
They point beyond themselves to some higher
fact which is not cognizable by our senses or perhaps our
understanding, but which is yet genuinely cognizable and
so in some high sense fact. Yet they are not, as we envisage
them, the fact to which they point, but a substitute for
or representative of that&mdash;an anticipation of or prevision
of it, a symbol of a fact. Their own kind or degree of
reality is sometimes called 'validity'&mdash;a term I do not
like: it might be more simply named 'rightness' with
the connotation of a certain incumbency and imperativeness
as well as of an appeal or adjustment to our nature
as we know it; or perhaps all we can say is that their
reality&mdash;it seems a paradox that an ideal should possess
'reality'&mdash;consists in their suggestiveness of modes of
action and their applicability to it, all this being supported
by the conception of a state of affairs beyond
and around us which makes it 'right'.</p>

<p>If all this is so, Progress as an ideal of action cannot be
precisely identical with Progress as a fact or object of
actual or possible knowledge. We can never know what
we are aiming at. But though different, the two are and
must be congruent, and this may be enough to justify us in
using the one name for the two. Unless there were Progress
as fact everywhere and always in the universe&mdash;outside
us&mdash;in Nature and History, and unless we took ourselves
genuinely to apprehend this, we could not form the practical
ideal of Progress, or at least the ideal could not be
right. But the difference remains, and we must be prepared
for and allow for it; though we can use the knowledge
we obtain of the fact of Progress to control and
guide our formulation of the practical ideal, we cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
identify the one with the other. Our imagining and our
supposing of what is best for or obligatory upon us to do
or work for, must go on under conditions&mdash;the conditions
of what we know as to the nature of ourselves and our
surroundings&mdash;and yet under these conditions has a very
large liberty or autonomy.</p>

<p>The Progress which is to serve as a practical ideal is
not and cannot be the Progress that we know, but must
be the result of imagination or supposition, and it is high
and necessary wisdom to trust our imaginations and
aspirations. The forms which it rightly takes cannot be
determined by what we have learned in or from the past;
it cometh not with observation, and the sources of experience
cannot of themselves supply us with it, and though
it comes in and with experience, it does not come from or
out of it. Yet it is due to an impression made upon us
by the Universe as we by our faculties apprehend it, and
is not merely subjective or of subjective origin. Begotten
of the imagination, it is appearance, not ultimate reality,
and it cannot be thought out or wholly evacuated of
mystery and perplexity. Is this not involved in the language
we use of it, proclaiming it practical and therefore
not theoretical?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while I must acknowledge this insuperable
difference between the Progress we can make our
end or ideal and the Progress we believe that in ourselves
and around us we apprehend, I still would lay renewed
stress upon the congruence and affinity of the two, and
urge that the perception of the one&mdash;the Progress without
us&mdash;and the pursuit of the other&mdash;the Progress within
us&mdash;support and fertilize each the other. The more we
know or can learn of the one the more effectively do we
pursue the other, and conversely. The light and the
fruits are bound together: the theory and the practice
of Progress cannot be dissevered without the ruin of both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>The ideal of Progress which we present to ourselves is
and must be one which is partly determined or limited
by past achievement and partly enlarged by the study
of what powers higher than our own have accomplished
and are accomplishing. The formation of it must move
constantly between a respect for what has been achieved
and a worship, so to speak, for what is far better than
anything that yet has been or become fact, and therefore
incumbent or imperative upon us.</p>

<p>The mode and manner of the Progress which is achieved
in the Universe has become in various ways clearer to us
and opens out undreamt-of possibilities, and our assurance
of its reality is ever more and more confirmed, while
on the other hand its actual or past results at the lower
level of nature have grown and are growing more familiar.
We see that Progress is the essential and therefore eternal
form of life and spiritual being, which endows it everywhere
with worth and substance. With this comes the
conviction that the source of all this lies inward, in that
inwardness where our true selves lie and springs from the
very nature of that. The spirit which is within us is not
other than the spirit which upholds and maintains the
whole Universe and works after the same fashion. And
with regard to this its manner of working, we have learned
that it proceeds by taking account of its own past achievements,
imagining or conceiving for itself tasks relevant to
these but not limited by them, and finds in that the conditions
and stimulus to their actualization. It is our business
to imitate this procedure and so to contribute to the advance
of the whole. No work so done is or can be lost. We
are justified in supposing that in so doing we are leagued
together in effective co-operation with one another and
with all other forces at work in the whole. In and through
us, though not in and through us only, Progress goes on,
drawing us along with it. Inner and outer Progress, free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
allegiance and loyal subjection concur and do not clash,
and the world in which we live and act appears to us as
it is&mdash;a city of God which is also a self-governed and self-administered
city of free men.</p>

<p>But above all, what it prescribes to us is the duty&mdash;another
name for 'the ideal of action'&mdash;to seek first light
as to the true nature of our world and ourselves, dismissing
and disregarding all appearance, however charming
or seductive. Unless we learn to see Progress as universal
and omnipresent and omnipotent, we shall set before
ourselves ideals of action which are false and treacherous.
We must exert ourselves not merely to apprehend, but
to dwell in the apprehension and vision of it.</p>

<p>And if there were no other reason, we should know it
for the right ideal&mdash;this command first to seek light&mdash;because
it is the hardest thing that can be asked of us
or that we can ask of ourselves. But what is thus asked
is not mere Faith and Hope, but a loyal adherence to the
knowledge which is within us.</p>

<p>Is this not the hardest? To-day, when over there in
France and Flanders, and indeed almost all over Europe,
as in a sort of Devil's smithy, men are busied in the most
horrid self-destruction. The accumulated stores of age-long
and patient industry are being consumed and annihilated;
the works and monuments of civilized life are
laid low: all physical and intellectual energies are bent
to the service of destruction. The very surface of the
kindly and fertile earth is seamed and scarred and wasted.
And the human beings who live and move in this inferno,
are jerked like puppets hither and thither by the operation
of passions to which we dare not venture to give
names, lest we be found either not condemning what defiles
and imbrutes our nature or denying our meed of praise
and gratitude to what ennobles it. All this portentous
activity and business flows from no other fount and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
fed by no other spring than the spirit which is within us,
that spirit which has created that wealth, material, artistic,
spiritual, which it is so busily engaged in wrecking and
undoing. It is still as of old, making History, making it
in the old fashion with the old ends in view and by the
exercise of its old familiar powers. And if in this tragic
scene or episode we cannot still read the features of
Progress, our theory is a baseless dream, and we can
frame no valid or 'right' ideal of action. For except to
an environment known to be still, because always, the
work and self-expression of a spirit akin to, and indeed
identical with our own, and except as knowing ourselves
to be still, because always, in all our ways of working its
vehicles and instruments, we can neither define nor realize
any ideals of action at all. This war is not an accident,
nor an outburst of subterranean natural forces, but the
act and deed of human will, and being so it cannot be
merely evil.</p>

<p>What, then, can we read not into, but out of, the tragic
spectacle now being enacted, not merely before but in,
through, and by us? Unless we have all along been
mistaken, the victims of mere delusion and error, here,
too, there has been and still is Progress. Primarily and
principally what is taking place, is a tremendous revelation
of the potencies which in our nature&mdash;in that which
makes us men&mdash;have escaped our notice and therefore,
because unseen or ignored, working in the dark, have not
yet been drawn upon and utilized. There has been and
still is going on, an enormous increase of self-knowledge.
At first sight this seems wholly an opening up of undreamt-of
evil. Side by side there has come to us a parallel revelation
of undreamt-of good. I must bear witness to my
conviction that we are beholding a tremendous inrush
or uprush of good into man and his world. But what I
wish to dwell upon is the growing and ever-confirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
revelation of an intimate relation or connexion between
the two which is the very spring of Progress, viz. that
the supply of good is not only adequate and more than
adequate to the utmost demand made upon it, in the combating
of the evil, and that for this reason, that while on
the one hand the evil that impedes or counter-works the
good is itself of spiritual origin, its existence and power
is conditioned by the law that it must evoke and stimulate
the very power which it attempts to crush and
defeat. This is, as I have said, the now discovered and
known spring of Progress both within and without us,
that whatsoever is evil, evil just because it is enacted
and does not merely occur, passes within the reach of
knowledge and understanding, and in the measure that
it passes into the light, not merely loses its sting and its
force, but is convertible and converted into a strengthening
condition of that which in its first appearance it seemed
merely to thwart. Even regress is seen to be a necessary
incident in progress, and the seasons which we call periods
of decadence to be occasions in which the spirit progresses
in secret, recruiting itself not by idleness or rest, but
genuinely refreshing and recreating itself.</p>

<p>The view here suggested is no sentimental optimism.
The drama of the universe is no comedy or even melodrama,
but a tragedy or epic of heroism, and more
especially is this the character of the history of the spirit
which is in Man and is Man. The evil we enact is real
evil, the only real evil, the checks which our disobedience
or disloyalty imposes upon the course of good, are genuine
retardations or frustrations; nevertheless they are not
wholly evil, for nothing is such, but are the means which
the spirit that has begotten them, utilizes in its eternal
Progress and wins out of them a richness, a complex and
varied harmony to which they are compelled to contribute.
Our ideal of action must therefore in principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
acknowledge as essential, what I have called the 'tragic'
character suggested by the spectacle of the war, the fear and
agony which we imagine in Nature and comprehendingly
discern in human history. The Progress which we can
achieve or contribute to&mdash;which we can make our ideal
of action&mdash;is one which cannot rightly be conceived otherwise
than in its essence a victory over evil, and that it
may be evil, it must come and be done in the dark. For the
spirit in progressing deposits what, being abandoned by
it, corrupts into venomous evil, but except in meeting and
combating that, it cannot progress. And it can only
combat it by getting to know it, for in darkness and
ignorance it can make no secure advance.</p>

<p>It has been profoundly said that to know all is to forgive
all. Let us rather say that in coming to know its own
past, the Spirit which is in Man can without undoing it&mdash;that
it cannot&mdash;make it contributory to its own wealth
of being, can, as I have said, utilize it for its own purposes,
which are summed up in the knowing of itself. There
is and can be nothing in its deeds which it cannot know,
and so digest and assimilate and absorb into its own
substance.</p>

<p>In this interpretation of the meaning&mdash;the veiled but
not hidden meaning of what has taken place and is taking
place in the world&mdash;or rather in us and enacted by us,
I seem to myself not to be expressing any private imagination
or supposition which may or may not be so, but
a certainty that it must be so. Either it is so or 'the
pillared firmament is rottenness and earth's base built
on stubble'. And this means that everywhere and always,
but most specially and centrally and potently in man's
spirit, there is Progress, in spite of checks and hindrances
which come from within it, a constant if chequered
advance in true worth or value. And that knowledge I
build on grounded and reasoned hope that it will and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
must continue&mdash;how, I do not know, but can only surmise
and conjecture and imagine.</p>

<p>To the question, What, then, ought we to do? I can
only reply first and foremost, Labour to retain this
truth, fostering and developing it, verifying it as we
have been doing in all the varied departments of human
experience, exercising our imaginations while at the
same time sobering and controlling them by the light
that comes from it. If we are true to it and do not
through slackness forget and lose it, we shall find
arising spontaneously out of the depths of our self worthy
and feasible ideals of action, the pursuit of which will not
betray us or leave us without an ever-growing assurance
that in bending and directing all our powers to their
realization we are the agents of that Progress which is
the source of all being and all worth whatsoever. If we
will to learn from our own past, we can convert anything
that is evil in it into an occasion, an opportunity, a means
to good which without it were not possible. Thus we can
even do what seems utterly impossible, for we can without
forgetting or ignoring or denying, forgive ourselves even
the evil which we have done. Yes, even the darkest and
worst evil, the disloyalty to ourselves, to the best and
deepest within us, which all but achieved the impossibility
of finally defeating the march of Progress. For
the basis and ground of our belief in the reality, and
therefore the eternity, of Progress lies in this, that the
now known nature of the Spirit which is in Man and not
in Man alone, is that it can heal any wounds that it can
inflict upon itself, can find in its own errors and failures,
in its own mistakes and misdeeds, if it only will, the
materials of richer and fuller and worthier life.</p>
